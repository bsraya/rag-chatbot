often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by. This article aims to provide the reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms that will allow her to put them to use. In the course of this overview, we look at different variants of gradient descent, summarize challenges, introduce the most common optimization algorithms, review architectures in a parallel and distributed setting, and investigate additional strategies for optimizing gradient descent.\nContextualized Text:\nGradient descent optimization algorithms are increasingly popular but are often treated as 'black-box' optimizers due to a lack of practical explanations of their functionalities.

gradient descent, optimization, neural networks, deep learning\nKey Objects: optimization algorithms, neural networks\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is gradient descent so popular for neural network optimization?\n- What does it mean for optimization algorithms to be used as 'black boxes'?\n- What are some potential benefits of understanding the strengths and weaknesses

treated as 'black boxes' lacking practical explanation.\nOriginal Text:\n## 1 Introduction  \nGradient descent is one of the most popular algorithms to perform optimization and by far the most common way to optimize neural networks. At the same time, every state-of-the-art Deep Learning library contains implementations of various algorithms to optimize gradient descent (e.g. lasagne's 2 , caffe's 3 , and keras' 4 documentation). These algorithms, however, are often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by.\nContextualized Text:\nGradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm, and the most common method for optimizing neural networks.

gradient descent, optimization algorithms, neural networks, training\nKey Objects: gradient descent optimization algorithms, optimization\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are some of the challenges encountered during training that necessitate specialized optimization algorithms?\n- How do different optimization algorithms address the identified challenges in gradient descent?\n- Why is optimizing gradient descent important for the performance of neural networks?\n---\nSummary:\nThis article aims to provide readers with an understanding of gradient descent optimization algorithms, outlining the structure of the paper and the topics that will be covered.\nOriginal Text:\nThis article aims at providing the reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms for optimizing gradient descent that will help her put them to use. In Section 2, we are first going to look at the different variants of gradient descent. We will then briefly summarize challenges during training in Section 3. Subsequently, in Section 4, we will introduce the most common optimization algorithms by showing their motivation to resolve these challenges and how this leads to the derivation of their update rules. Afterwards, in Section 5, we will take a short look at algorithms and architectures to optimize gradient descent in a parallel and distributed setting. Finally, we will consider additional strategies that are helpful for optimizing gradient descent in Section 6.\nContextualized Text:\nThe purpose of this article is to give readers an intuitive understanding of the behavior of gradient descent optimization algorithms, which are commonly used to train neural networks.

gradient descent, objective function, learning rate, parameters\nKey Objects: objective function, parameters, gradient, learning rate\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What does it mean for gradient descent to find a 'local' minimum?\n- How does a larger learning rate affect the optimization process?\n- Why is it important to update parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient?\n---\nSummary:\nGradient descent minimizes an objective function by iteratively updating model parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient, with the learning rate determining the step size.\nOriginal Text:\nGradient descent is a way to minimize an objective function J ( θ ) parameterized by a model's parameters θ ∈ R d by updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function ∇ θ J ( θ ) w.r.t. to the parameters. The learning rate η determines the size of the steps we take to reach a (local) minimum. In other words, we follow the direction of the slope of the surface created by the objective function downhill until we reach a valley. 5  \n∗ This paper originally appeared as a blog post at http://sebastianruder.com/ optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html on 19 January 2016.  \n2 http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/updates.html  \n3 http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/tutorial/solver.html  \n4 http://keras.io/optimizers/  \n5 If you are unfamiliar with gradient descent, you can find a good introduction on optimizing neural networks at http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-1/ .\nContextualized Text:\nAs a foundational optimization algorithm, gradient descent minimizes an objective function (J(θ)) by updating model parameters (θ) in the direction opposite to the gradient of the objective function (∇θ J(θ)).

gradient descent, objective function, parameter update\nKey Objects: Gradient Descent, Parameter Update, Objective Function\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are the three variants of gradient descent?\n- How does the amount of data used affect the accuracy of parameter updates?\n- What are the advantages and disadvantages of using more or less data for gradient descent?\n---\nSummary:\nGradient descent has three variants that differ in the amount of data used to compute the objective function's gradient, resulting in a trade-off between parameter update accuracy and update time.\nOriginal Text:\n## 2 Gradient descent variants  \nThere are three variants of gradient descent, which differ in how much data we use to compute the gradient of the objective function. Depending on the amount of data, we make a trade-off between the accuracy of the parameter update and the time it takes to perform an update.\nContextualized Text:\nThree variants of gradient descent exist, each differing in the volume of data employed to calculate the gradient of the objective function.

batch gradient descent, gradient descent, cost function, training dataset, parameters, learning rate\nKey Objects: cost function, parameters, training dataset, gradient\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is batch gradient descent slow compared to other optimization methods?\n- What are the limitations of batch gradient descent when dealing with datasets that exceed available memory?\n- How does the learning rate influence the parameter updates in batch gradient descent?\n---\nSummary:\nBatch gradient descent calculates the gradient of the cost function using the entire training dataset to update parameters, making it slow and unsuitable for large datasets.\nOriginal Text:\n### 2.1 Batch gradient descent  \nVanilla gradient descent, aka batch gradient descent, computes the gradient of the cost function w.r.t. to the parameters θ for the entire training dataset:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nAs we need to calculate the gradients for the whole dataset to perform just one update, batch gradient descent can be very slow and is intractable for datasets that do not fit in memory. Batch gradient descent also does not allow us to update our model online , i.e. with new examples on-the-fly.  \nIn code, batch gradient descent looks something like this:  \n```\nfor i in range(nb_epochs): params_grad = evaluate_gradient(loss_function , data , params) params = params -learning_rate * params_grad\n```\nContextualized Text:\nVanilla gradient descent, also known as batch gradient descent, computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to model parameters using the entire training dataset.

batch gradient descent, gradient descent, cost function, parameters, learning rate, automatic differentiation\nKey Objects: parameters, cost function, gradient\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is batch gradient descent considered 'slow'?\n- What is the role of the 'learning rate' in the parameter update process?\n- How does automatic differentiation simplify the gradient calculation?\n---\nSummary:\nBatch gradient descent iteratively updates model parameters by computing the gradient of the cost function over the entire training dataset and adjusting parameters accordingly.\nOriginal Text:\n```\nfor i in range(nb_epochs): params_grad = evaluate_gradient(loss_function , data , params) params = params -learning_rate * params_grad\n```  \nFor a pre-defined number of epochs, we first compute the gradient vector params\\_grad of the loss function for the whole dataset w.r.t. our parameter vector params . Note that state-of-the-art deep learning libraries provide automatic differentiation that efficiently computes the gradient w.r.t. some parameters. If you derive the gradients yourself, then gradient checking is a good idea. 6  \nWe then update our parameters in the direction of the gradients with the learning rate determining how big of an update we perform. Batch gradient descent is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum for convex error surfaces and to a local minimum for non-convex surfaces.\nContextualized Text:\nIn batch gradient descent, the model's parameters are updated by first calculating the gradient of the cost function with respect to these parameters for the entire training dataset. For a pre-defined number of epochs, the gradient vector, params_grad, is computed and the parameters are adjusted using a learning rate to determine the magnitude of the update. This iterative process, batch gradient descent, is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum for convex error surfaces and to a local minimum for non-convex surfaces.	{"tags": ["optimization", "machine learning", "deep learning", "algorithm"], "doc_id": "09121bec-e2b4-4b3b-8f29-b0548817e426", "summary": "Batch gradient descent iteratively updates model parameters by computing the gradient of the cost function over the entire training dataset and adjusting parameters accordingly.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": [], "keywords": ["batch gradient descent", "gradient descent", "cost function", "parameters", "learning rate", "automatic differentiation"], "key_objects": ["parameters", "cost function", "gradient"], "contextual_text": "In batch gradient descent, the model's parameters are updated by first calculating the gradient of the cost function with respect to these parameters for the entire training dataset.

stochastic gradient descent, SGD, parameter updates, batch gradient descent, online learning\nKey Objects: training examples, parameters, gradients\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is the main advantage of SGD compared to batch gradient descent?\n- Why does SGD’s frequent updates with high variance cause the objective function to fluctuate?\n- In what scenarios would SGD be particularly beneficial for learning?\n---\nSummary:\nStochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates parameters for each training example, overcoming the redundancy of batch gradient descent and enabling faster online learning.\nOriginal Text:\n### 2.2 Stochastic gradient descent  \nStochastic gradient descent (SGD) in contrast performs a parameter update for each training example x ( i ) and label y ( i ) :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nBatch gradient descent performs redundant computations for large datasets, as it recomputes gradients for similar examples before each parameter update. SGD does away with this redundancy by performing one update at a time. It is therefore usually much faster and can also be used to learn online. SGD performs frequent updates with a high variance that cause the objective function to fluctuate heavily as in Figure 1.\nContextualized Text:\nUnlike batch gradient descent, which recomputes gradients for similar examples, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) performs a parameter update for each individual training example and its associated label.

stochastic gradient descent, local minima, learning rate, convergence\nKey Objects: stochastic gradient descent, local minima, learning rate, convergence\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why does SGD's fluctuation sometimes help during optimization?\n- How does decreasing the learning rate affect SGD's convergence behavior?\n- What is the trade-off between escaping local minima and converging to the exact minimum when using SGD?\n---\nSummary:\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) fluctuations can help it escape local minima but complicate convergence, though decreasing the learning rate allows it to behave similarly to batch gradient descent.\nOriginal Text:\nWhile batch gradient descent converges to the minimum of the basin the parameters are placed in, SGD's fluctuation, on the one hand, enables it to jump to new and potentially better local minima. On the other hand, this ultimately complicates convergence to the exact minimum, as SGD will keep overshooting. However, it has been shown that when we slowly decrease the learning rate, SGD shows the same convergence behaviour as batch gradient descent, almost certainly converging to a local or the global minimum for non-convex and convex optimization respectively. Its code fragment simply adds a loop over the training examples and evaluates the gradient w.r.t. each example. Note that we shuffle the training data at every epoch as explained in Section 6.1.  \n```\nfor i in range(nb_epochs): np.random.shuffle(data) for example in data: params_grad = evaluate_gradient(loss_function , example , params) params = params -learning_rate * params_grad\n```\nContextualized Text:\nUnlike batch gradient descent, which converges to the minimum of the parameter basin, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) exhibits fluctuations during the optimization process. These fluctuations allow SGD to potentially jump to new and better local minima. However, this also complicates convergence to the exact minimum, as SGD tends to overshoot. Fortunately, gradually decreasing the learning rate enables SGD to converge similarly to batch gradient descent, and likely find a local or global minimum for both convex and non-convex optimization problems.	{"tags": ["optimization", "machine-learning", "algorithm"], "doc_id": "50ffa41c-456c-4d05-b0e3-fecb3c1b32ad", "summary": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) fluctuations can help it escape local minima but complicate convergence, though decreasing the learning rate allows it to behave similarly to batch gradient descent.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": [], "keywords": ["stochastic gradient descent", "local minima", "learning rate", "convergence"], "key_objects": ["stochastic gradient descent", "local minima", "learning rate", "convergence"], "contextual_text": "Unlike batch gradient descent, which converges to the minimum of the parameter basin, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) exhibits fluctuations during the optimization process.

convergence behavior of SGD?\n- What are the trade-offs between using SGD versus batch gradient descent?\n---\nSummary:\nStochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates model parameters by evaluating the gradient with respect to each training example and adjusting the parameters accordingly.\nOriginal Text:\n```\nfor i in range(nb_epochs): np.random.shuffle(data) for example in data: params_grad =

gradients properly.  \nFigure 1: SGD fluctuation (Source: Wikipedia)  \n\nContextualized Text:\nIn stochastic gradient descent (SGD), model parameters are updated iteratively. For each epoch, the training data is shuffled, and then for each training example, the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters is evaluated. The parameters are subsequently adjusted by subtracting the learning rate multiplied by this gradient. This process, as described in the provided code fragment, allows for faster updates compared to batch gradient descent, but introduces fluctuations in the objective function.	{"tags": ["optimization", "machine learning", "algorithm", "deep learning"], "doc_id": "cd5b36c0-a3f3-4983-8e50-69302a2f52ba", "summary": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates model parameters by evaluating the gradient with respect to each training example and adjusting the parameters accordingly.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Wikipedia", "http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/"], "keywords": ["stochastic gradient descent", "SGD", "parameter updates", "training examples", "gradient evaluation"], "key_objects": ["training examples", "model parameters", "gradients", "learning rate"], "contextual_text": "In stochastic gradient descent (SGD), model parameters are updated iteratively.

title: Time Series Graph\nTags: time-series, graph, data, trend, sequence, fluctuation\nKey objects: Time Series, X-axis, Y-axis, Data Points, Trend Line\n---\nSummary:\nThis graph displays a time series data showing fluctuations around a decreasing trend. The x-axis represents time or a sequence number, while the y-axis shows the corresponding values, which predominantly range between -10 and -8.\nFull description:\nThe image depicts a line graph representing a time series. The x-axis ranges from approximately 0 to 3500, and the y-axis ranges from -10 to -4. The data points fluctuate significantly but exhibit a general decreasing trend over time.  The values oscillate above and below a decreasing path, suggesting some form of dynamic process. The graph showcases changes in values across the sequence, with noticeable peaks and valleys interspersed along the downward slope.\nText found in image:\n- -10\n- -8\n- -4	{"tags": ["time-series", "graph", "data", "trend", "sequence", "fluctuation"], "title": "Time Series Graph", "doc_id": "ddc1d439-0036-4ccd-b651-deb5b1ac7447", "source": "./images/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms/image_1.png", "summary": "This graph displays a time series data showing fluctuations around a decreasing trend.

2.3 Mini-batch gradient descent  \nMini-batch gradient descent finally takes the best of both worlds and performs an update for every mini-batch of n training examples:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThis way, it a) reduces the variance of the parameter updates, which can lead to more stable convergence; and b) can make use of highly optimized matrix optimizations common to state-of-the-art deep learning libraries that make computing the gradient w.r.t. a mini-batch very efficient. Common mini-batch sizes range between 50 and 256 , but can vary for different applications. Mini-batch gradient descent is typically the algorithm of choice when training a neural network and the term SGD usually is employed also when mini-batches are used. Note: In modifications of SGD in the rest of this post, we leave out the parameters x ( i : i + n ) ; y ( i : i + n ) for simplicity.  \nIn code, instead of iterating over examples, we now iterate over mini-batches of size 50 :  \n```\nContextualized Text:\nMini-batch gradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm that performs updates for every mini-batch of 'n' training examples, offering a balance between variance reduction and computational efficiency.

mini-batch gradient descent, training data, model parameters, iteration, optimization\nKey Objects: mini-batches, model parameters, training data\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is it beneficial to use mini-batches instead of individual examples or the entire dataset?\n- What is the role of the learning rate in updating the model parameters?\n- How does `np.random.shuffle(data)` affect the training process?\n---\nSummary:\nThe code snippet demonstrates mini-batch gradient descent by iterating over mini-batches of training data to update model parameters.\nOriginal Text:\nIn code, instead of iterating over examples, we now iterate over mini-batches of size 50 :  \n```\nfor i in range(nb_epochs): np.random.shuffle(data) for batch in get_batches(data, batch_size=50): params_grad = evaluate_gradient(loss_function , batch , params) params = params -learning_rate * params_grad\n```\nContextualized Text:\nMini-batch gradient descent performs an update for every mini-batch of training examples. This approach reduces variance and leverages optimized matrix operations. The following code snippet illustrates this process: The code iterates over mini-batches of size 50, calculates the gradient for each batch, and updates the model parameters using a learning rate.	{"tags": ["optimization", "machine learning", "deep learning", "code"], "doc_id": "e0db6713-377d-4c90-a9e8-64b4c7a7e80c", "summary": "The code snippet demonstrates mini-batch gradient descent by iterating over mini-batches of training data to update model parameters.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": [], "keywords": ["mini-batch gradient descent", "training data", "model parameters", "iteration", "optimization"], "key_objects": ["mini-batches", "model parameters", "training data"], "contextual_text": "Mini-batch gradient descent performs an update for every mini-batch of training examples.

What are the limitations of using pre-defined schedules for learning rates?\n---\nSummary:\nVanilla mini-batch gradient descent faces challenges including selecting an appropriate learning rate and the limitations of pre-defined learning rate schedules.\nOriginal Text:\n## 3 Challenges  \nVanilla mini-batch gradient descent, however, does not guarantee good convergence, but offers a few challenges that need to be addressed:  \n- Choosing a proper learning rate can be difficult. A learning rate that is too small leads to painfully slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large can hinder convergence and cause the loss function to fluctuate around the minimum or even to diverge.\n- Learning rate schedules [18] try to adjust the learning rate during training by e.g. annealing, i.e. reducing the learning rate according to a pre-defined schedule or when the change in objective between epochs falls below a threshold. These schedules and thresholds, however, have to be defined in advance and are thus unable to adapt to a dataset's characteristics [4].\nContextualized Text:\nVanilla mini-batch gradient descent, while offering a pathway to optimization, presents several challenges. One significant hurdle is choosing an appropriate learning rate; a rate that is too small slows convergence, while a rate that is too large can hinder it, causing fluctuations or divergence. Learning rate schedules, which adjust the learning rate during training, attempt to address this, but their pre-defined schedules and thresholds are unable to adapt to the specific characteristics of a dataset.	{"tags": ["optimization", "machine learning", "deep learning", "challenges"], "doc_id": "3dff6915-b80c-49c2-8eb8-f8ef840534bf", "summary": "Vanilla mini-batch gradient descent faces challenges including selecting an appropriate learning rate and the limitations of pre-defined learning rate schedules.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": [], "keywords": ["learning rate", "mini-batch gradient descent", "convergence", "learning rate schedules", "annealing"], "key_objects": ["learning rate", "learning rate schedules", "mini-batch gradient descent"], "contextual_text": "Vanilla mini-batch gradient descent, while offering a pathway to optimization, presents several challenges.

learning rate, parameter updates, sparse data, feature frequencies\nKey Objects: learning rate, parameters, features\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is it problematic to apply the same learning rate to all parameters?\n- How would you adapt the learning rate to address the issue of varying feature frequencies?\n- What are the implications of updating rarely occurring features to a lesser extent?\n---\nSummary:\nA challenge with standard mini-batch gradient descent is that applying the same learning rate to all parameters may not be optimal, particularly when dealing with sparse data and features with varying frequencies.\nOriginal Text:\n- Additionally, the same learning rate applies to all parameter updates. If our data is sparse and our features have very different frequencies, we might not want to update all of them to the same extent, but perform a larger update for rarely occurring features.\n- Another key challenge of minimizing highly non-convex error functions common for neural networks is avoiding getting trapped in their numerous suboptimal local minima. Dauphin et al. [5] argue that the difficulty arises in fact not from local minima but from saddle points, i.e. points where one dimension slopes up and another slopes down. These saddle points are usually surrounded by a plateau of the same error, which makes it notoriously hard for SGD to escape, as the gradient is close to zero in all dimensions.\nContextualized Text:\nWhen using mini-batch gradient descent, a challenge arises because the same learning rate is applied to all parameter updates.

SGD, Momentum, ravines, oscillations, update vector\nKey Objects: ravines, update vector, Momentum\nRefers to Images:

ravine-like surfaces?\n- What is the purpose of incorporating the past update vector when using Momentum?\n---\nSummary:\nMomentum is a technique designed to address the limitations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by accelerating updates and reducing oscillations when navigating complex, ravine-like surfaces.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.1 Momentum  \nSGD has trouble navigating ravines, i.e. areas where the surface curves much more steeply in one dimension than in another [20], which are common around local optima. In these scenarios, SGD oscillates across the slopes of the ravine while only making hesitant progress along the bottom towards the local optimum as in Figure 2a.  \nFigure 2: Source: Genevieve B. Orr  \n  \nMomentum [17] is a method that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations as can be seen in Figure 2b. It does this by adding a fraction γ of the update vector of the past time step to the current update vector 8  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThe momentum term γ is usually set to 0 . 9 or a similar value.\nContextualized Text:\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) can struggle with 'ravines,' areas with steep curves in one dimension, often found near local optima. To overcome this, Momentum is a technique that helps accelerate SGD updates and dampen oscillations. It achieves this by incorporating a fraction (γ) of the previous update vector into the current update vector.	{"tags": ["optimization", "machine-learning", "algorithm"], "doc_id": "6828452b-66eb-44ab-9312-565d0b7d36f9", "summary": "Momentum is a technique designed to address the limitations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by accelerating updates and reducing oscillations when navigating complex, ravine-like surfaces.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["SGD"], "keywords": ["SGD", "Momentum", "ravines", "oscillations", "update vector"], "key_objects": ["ravines", "update vector", "Momentum"], "contextual_text": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) can struggle with 'ravines,' areas with steep curves in one dimension, often found near local optima.

title: SGD with and without Momentum\nTags: sgd, optimization, momentum, neural-networks, cost-function, gradient-descent\nKey objects: Cost Function Landscape, Elliptical Contours, SGD Trajectory (without momentum), SGD Trajectory (with momentum)\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates the difference between Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) without momentum and SGD with momentum. Both diagrams depict a cost function landscape represented by elliptical contours. The trajectories of the optimization process are shown as lines, highlighting how momentum can smooth out oscillations and accelerate convergence.\nFull description:\nThe diagram presents two visualizations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Diagram (a) shows SGD without momentum. The path taken by the optimizer oscillates significantly due to the noisy gradient estimates, resulting in a meandering trajectory. Diagram (b) shows SGD with momentum. The path exhibits a smoother trajectory, as momentum helps to average out the noisy gradient estimates and dampen the oscillations. This allows the optimizer to move more consistently toward the minimum of the cost function.\nText found in image:\n- (a) SGD without momentum\n- (b) SGD with momentum	{"tags": ["sgd", "optimization", "momentum", "neural-networks", "cost-function", "gradient-descent"], "title": "SGD with and without Momentum", "doc_id": "7e91853d-48dc-49a2-803d-f1d424fddb59", "source": "./images/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms/image_2.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates the difference between Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) without momentum and SGD with momentum.

momentum, parameter updates, convergence, oscillation, gradient descent\nKey Objects: momentum term, parameter updates, gradients\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is it beneficial to accumulate momentum when updating parameters?\n- What is the effect of a γ value close to 1 versus a value closer to 0?\n- How does momentum help overcome oscillations in gradient descent?\n---\nSummary:\nThe momentum term, typically set to 0.9, accelerates parameter updates by accumulating momentum from past gradients, leading to faster convergence and reduced oscillation.\nOriginal Text:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThe momentum term γ is usually set to 0 . 9 or a similar value.  \nEssentially, when using momentum, we push a ball down a hill. The ball accumulates momentum as it rolls downhill, becoming faster and faster on the way (until it reaches its terminal velocity, if there is air resistance, i.e. γ &lt; 1 ). The same thing happens to our parameter updates: The momentum term increases for dimensions whose gradients point in the same directions and reduces updates for dimensions whose gradients change directions. As a result, we gain faster convergence and reduced oscillation.\nContextualized Text:\nTo address the challenges of standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) when navigating areas with steep directional changes, momentum is employed. The momentum term, often set to a value like 0.9, helps accelerate parameter updates. It accumulates momentum from past gradients, resulting in faster convergence and reduced oscillation. This can be visualized as pushing a ball down a hill, where the ball gains speed as it rolls.	{"tags": ["optimization", "machine learning", "deep learning"], "doc_id": "36214953-f3d0-4089-983d-29e55f2a280b", "summary": "The momentum term, typically set to 0.9, accelerates parameter updates by accumulating momentum from past gradients, leading to faster convergence and reduced oscillation.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["gradient descent"], "keywords": ["momentum", "parameter updates", "convergence", "oscillation", "gradient descent"], "key_objects": ["momentum term", "parameter updates", "gradients"], "contextual_text": "To address the challenges of standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) when navigating areas with steep directional changes, momentum is employed.

Nesterov accelerated gradient, momentum term, parameter position, gradient descent\nKey Objects: Nesterov accelerated gradient, momentum term, parameters\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does NAG improve upon standard gradient descent?\n- What is the purpose of computing the gradient with respect to the approximate future position of parameters?\n- Why is it beneficial for the momentum term to have a sense of direction?\n---\nSummary:\nNesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) provides a method to enhance momentum by giving it a sense of direction, allowing it to anticipate the next parameter position and adjust accordingly.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.2 Nesterov accelerated gradient  \nHowever, a ball that rolls down a hill, blindly following the slope, is highly unsatisfactory. We would like to have a smarter ball, a ball that has a notion of where it is going so that it knows to slow down before the hill slopes up again.  \nNesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) [14] is a way to give our momentum term this kind of prescience. Weknow that we will use our momentum term γv t -1 to move the parameters θ . Computing θ -γv t -1 thus gives us an approximation of the next position of the parameters (the gradient is missing for the full update), a rough idea where our parameters are going to be. We can now effectively look ahead by calculating the gradient not w.r.t. to our current parameters θ but w.r.t. the approximate future position of our parameters:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \n7 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s\\_method\\_in\\_optimization  \n8 Some implementations exchange the signs in the equations.\nContextualized Text:\nTo improve upon standard gradient descent, Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) was developed. NAG provides a method to give the momentum term a sense of direction, allowing it to anticipate the next parameter position and adjust accordingly. This technique computes an approximation of the next position of the parameters, enabling the calculation of the gradient with respect to this future position.	{"tags": ["optimization", "gradient descent", "machine learning"], "doc_id": "b30ab075-c0ad-4927-a6fb-a95adc981d42", "summary": "Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) provides a method to enhance momentum by giving it a sense of direction, allowing it to anticipate the next parameter position and adjust accordingly.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": [], "keywords": ["Nesterov accelerated gradient", "momentum term", "parameter position", "gradient descent"], "key_objects": ["Nesterov accelerated gradient", "momentum term", "parameters"], "contextual_text": "To improve upon standard gradient descent, Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) was developed.

./images/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms/image_3.png\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does NAG's approach of 'looking ahead' differ from standard momentum?\n- Why is the

Accelerated Gradient (NAG) improves upon standard momentum by anticipating future parameter positions, which prevents overshooting and increases responsiveness, ultimately boosting performance in tasks like RNNs.\nOriginal Text:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \n7 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s\\_method\\_in\\_optimization  \n8 Some implementations exchange the signs in the equations.  \nFigure 3: Nesterov update (Source: G. Hinton's lecture 6c)  \n  \nAgain, we set the momentum term γ to a value of around 0 . 9 . While Momentum first computes the current gradient (small blue vector in Figure 3) and then takes a big jump in the direction of the updated accumulated gradient (big blue vector), NAG first makes a big jump in the direction of the previous accumulated gradient (brown vector), measures the gradient and then makes a correction (green vector). This anticipatory update prevents us from going too fast and results in increased responsiveness, which has significantly increased the performance of RNNs on a number of tasks [2]. 9\nContextualized Text:\nTo improve upon standard momentum, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) approximates the next position of the parameters by computing a rough idea of where the parameters are going.

Adadelta, Adagrad, learning rate, optimization, squared gradients\nKey Objects: Adadelta, Adagrad, learning rate, past gradients\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does Adadelta differ from Adagrad in terms of how it handles past gradients?\n- Why is it problematic for an optimization algorithm to have a monotonically decreasing learning rate?\n- What is the purpose of limiting the window of accumulated past gradients in Adadelta?\n---\nSummary:\nAdadelta is an optimization algorithm that builds upon Adagrad by addressing its issue of a rapidly decreasing learning rate by restricting the window of accumulated past gradients.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.4 Adadelta  \nAdadelta [22] is an extension of Adagrad that seeks to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate. Instead of accumulating all past squared gradients, Adadelta restricts the window of accumulated past gradients to some fixed size w .  \nInstead of inefficiently storing w previous squared gradients, the sum of gradients is recursively defined as a decaying average of all past squared gradients. The running average E [ g 2 ] t at time step t then depends (as a fraction γ similarly to the Momentum term) only on the previous average and the current gradient:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nWe set γ to a similar value as the momentum term, around 0 . 9 . For clarity, we now rewrite our vanilla SGD update in terms of the parameter update vector ∆ θ t :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThe parameter update vector of Adagrad that we derived previously thus takes the form:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nContextualized Text:\nAs an extension of the Adagrad optimization algorithm, Adadelta aims to mitigate Adagrad's tendency to have a monotonically decreasing learning rate.

title: Three Intersecting Vectors\nTags: vector, direction, geometry, line, intersection\nKey objects: Blue Vector, Brown Vector, Green Vector, Intersection Point\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram depicts three vectors represented by lines, each with a distinct color: blue, brown, and green. The vectors intersect at a common point, illustrating their relative directions and how they cross paths.\nFull description:\nThe image shows three vectors meeting at a common intersection point. The first vector is colored blue and extends upwards and to the right. The second vector is brown and points downwards and to the right. The third vector is green and extends horizontally to the right. All three vectors meet at a single point.\nText found in image:\n- 	{"tags": ["vector", "direction", "geometry", "line", "intersection"], "title": "Three Intersecting Vectors", "doc_id": "3c23d925-3491-441d-8205-d0662512a989", "source": "./images/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms/image_3.png", "summary": "This diagram depicts three vectors represented by lines, each with a distinct color: blue, brown, and green.

parameter importance, update sizes, optimization\nKey Objects: parameters, updates\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How would one determine the 'importance' of a parameter?\n- What are the potential benefits of performing larger updates for some parameters and smaller updates for others?\n- How would this adaptation of update sizes impact the overall convergence behavior of the optimization process?\n---\nSummary:\nThe next step in optimization is to adapt update sizes for each individual parameter based on their importance.\nOriginal Text:\nNow that we are able to adapt our updates to the slope of our error function and speed up SGD in turn, we would also like to adapt our updates to each individual parameter to perform larger or smaller updates depending on their importance.\nContextualized Text:\nHaving adapted our updates to the slope of the error function and accelerated SGD, the next step is to further refine the process by adapting our updates to each individual parameter to perform larger or smaller updates depending on their importance.	{"tags": ["optimization", "SGD", "parameters"], "doc_id": "9cccbd90-e2c4-4551-9162-7805cb432f43", "summary":

for infrequent parameters and smaller updates for frequent ones, making it particularly effective for sparse data.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.3 Adagrad  \nAdagrad [8] is an algorithm for gradient-based optimization that does just this: It adapts the learning rate to the parameters, performing larger updates for infrequent and smaller updates for frequent parameters. For this reason, it is well-suited for dealing with sparse data. Dean et al. [6] have found that Adagrad greatly improved the robustness of SGD and used it for training large-scale neural nets at Google, which - among other things - learned to recognize cats in Youtube videos 10 . Moreover, Pennington et al. [16] used Adagrad to train GloVe word embeddings, as infrequent words require much larger updates than frequent ones.\nContextualized Text:\nAdagrad is an optimization algorithm designed to adapt the learning rate for each parameter in a model. It is particularly useful when dealing with sparse datasets, as it provides larger updates for infrequent parameters and smaller updates for frequent ones. This was demonstrated by Dean et al. who used Adagrad to train large-scale neural networks at Google, and by Pennington et al. who utilized it to train GloVe word embeddings.	{"tags": ["optimization", "deep-learning", "algorithm", "NLP"], "doc_id": "57baff05-8626-4e77-96b5-68752d2a1a4d", "summary": "Adagrad is a gradient-based optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter, providing larger updates for infrequent parameters and smaller updates for frequent ones, making it particularly effective for sparse data.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Adagrad", "SGD", "GloVe"], "keywords": ["Adagrad", "gradient-based optimization", "learning rate", "sparse data", "optimization algorithm"], "key_objects": ["learning rate", "parameters", "gradients"], "contextual_text": "Adagrad is an optimization algorithm designed to adapt the learning rate for each parameter in a model.

Adagrad, learning rate, parameter update, gradient descent, SGD\nKey Objects: parameters, learning rate, gradients\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is the main difference between the parameter update rule in SGD and the update rule used by Adagrad?\n- Why would adapting the learning rate for each parameter be advantageous?\n- What does g t,i represent in the context of the update rule?\n---\nSummary:\nPrior to Adagrad, all parameters were updated simultaneously using a single learning rate. Adagrad introduces a per-parameter learning rate, which is adapted based on past gradients, requiring a modified update rule.\nOriginal Text:\nPreviously, we performed an update for all parameters θ at once as every parameter θ i used the same learning rate η . As Adagrad uses a different learning rate for every parameter θ i at every time step t , we first show Adagrad's per-parameter update, which we then vectorize. For brevity, we set g t,i to be the gradient of the objective function w.r.t. to the parameter θ i at time step t :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThe SGD update for every parameter θ i at each time step t then becomes:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nIn its update rule, Adagrad modifies the general learning rate η at each time step t for every parameter θ i based on the past gradients that have been computed for θ i :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nContextualized Text:\nIn traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD), all parameters (θ) are updated at once, using a single learning rate (η). Adagrad deviates from this approach by adapting the learning rate for each parameter (θ i) at every time step (t), based on the accumulated past gradients. To illustrate this per-parameter adaptation, we're using g t,i to represent the gradient of the objective function with respect to parameter θ i at time step t.	{"tags": ["optimization", "algorithm", "machine learning"], "doc_id": "405d391b-19bd-4499-9341-3eafae3caacc", "summary": "Prior to Adagrad, all parameters were updated simultaneously using a single learning rate.

Adagrad, diagonal matrix, gradients, smoothing term, parameter update\nKey Objects: Gt, diagonal matrix, gradients, smoothing term\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is the purpose of including a smoothing term (epsilon1) in the update rule?\n- Why is Gt represented as a diagonal matrix, and what implications does this have for computation?\n- How does the accumulation of squared gradients affect the learning process in Adagrad?\n---\nSummary:\nIn Adagrad, Gt is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal element represents the sum of the squares of past gradients with respect to a parameter θi, and a smoothing term (epsilon1) prevents division by zero.\nOriginal Text:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nG t ∈ R d × d here is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal element i, i is the sum of the squares of the gradients w.r.t. θ i up to time step t 11 , while glyph[epsilon1] is a smoothing term that avoids division by zero (usually on the order of 1 e -8 ). Interestingly, without the square root operation, the algorithm performs much worse.  \n9 Refer to http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/ for another explanation of the intuitions behind NAG, while Ilya Sutskever gives a more detailed overview in his PhD thesis [19].  \n10 http://www.wired.com/2012/06/google-x-neural-network/  \n11 Duchi et al. [8] give this matrix as an alternative to the full matrix containing the outer products of all previous gradients, as the computation of the matrix square root is infeasible even for a moderate number of parameters d .\nContextualized Text:\nAdagrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on historical gradients. A key component of this process is Gt, a diagonal matrix. Each diagonal element (i, i) in Gt sums the squares of the gradients for parameter θi up to a given time step. A small smoothing term, often denoted as epsilon1, is also included to prevent division by zero during updates.	{"tags": ["optimization", "algorithm", "neural networks", "Adagrad"], "doc_id": "2b90aa20-ef1f-4a5e-a259-0781cde1bb4b", "summary": "In Adagrad, Gt is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal element represents the sum of the squares of past gradients with respect to a parameter θi, and a smoothing term (epsilon1) prevents division by zero.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Adagrad"], "keywords": ["Adagrad", "diagonal matrix", "gradients", "smoothing term", "parameter update"], "key_objects": ["Gt", "diagonal matrix", "gradients", "smoothing term"], "contextual_text": "Adagrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on historical gradients.

Adagrad, vectorization, learning rate, optimization, gradients\nKey Objects: Adagrad, Gt, gt, learning rate\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does vectorizing the implementation of Adagrad improve efficiency?\n- Why is it advantageous to eliminate the need for manual learning rate tuning?\n- What is the underlying problem with accumulating squared gradients in Adagrad?\n---\nSummary:\nAdagrad's implementation can be vectorized by performing an element-wise matrix-vector multiplication between Gt and gt, and it simplifies training by eliminating the need for manual learning rate tuning, although it has a key weakness related to accumulating squared gradients.\nOriginal Text:\nAs G t contains the sum of the squares of the past gradients w.r.t. to all parameters θ along its diagonal, we can now vectorize our implementation by performing an element-wise matrix-vector multiplication glyph[circledot] between G t and g t :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nOne of Adagrad's main benefits is that it eliminates the need to manually tune the learning rate. Most implementations use a default value of 0 . 01 and leave it at that.  \nAdagrad's main weakness is its accumulation of the squared gradients in the denominator: Since every added term is positive, the accumulated sum keeps growing during training. This in turn causes the learning rate to shrink and eventually become infinitesimally small, at which point the algorithm is no longer able to acquire additional knowledge. The following algorithms aim to resolve this flaw.\nContextualized Text:\nIn the Adagrad optimization algorithm, the diagonal matrix Gt, which contains the sum of the squares of past gradients, can be used to vectorize the implementation. This involves an element-wise matrix-vector multiplication between Gt and gt. A significant benefit of Adagrad is that it removes the need to manually adjust the learning rate; however, the accumulation of squared gradients presents a challenge.	{"tags": ["optimization", "algorithm", "deep-learning"], "doc_id": "0eaff04e-a986-43ee-8a4d-780be47270e9", "summary": "Adagrad's implementation can be vectorized by performing an element-wise matrix-vector multiplication between Gt and gt, and it simplifies training by eliminating the need for manual learning rate tuning, although it has a key weakness related to accumulating squared gradients.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": [], "keywords": ["Adagrad", "vectorization", "learning rate", "optimization", "gradients"], "key_objects": ["Adagrad", "Gt", "gt", "learning rate"], "contextual_text": "In the Adagrad optimization algorithm, the diagonal matrix Gt, which contains the sum of the squares of past gradients, can be used to vectorize the implementation.

Adadelta, Adagrad, parameter updates, squared gradients, root mean squared error, RMS\nKey Objects: Adagrad, Parameter Updates, Squared Gradients, RMS Error\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does Adadelta's decaying average address the limitations of Adagrad's accumulated gradients?\n- Why is it important to consider the units of the parameter update?\n- What is the purpose of calculating the exponentially decaying average of squared parameter updates?\n---\nSummary:\nAdadelta modifies the Adagrad update rule by replacing the diagonal matrix of accumulated squared gradients with a decaying average of past squared gradients, and addresses unit inconsistencies by introducing a decaying average of squared parameter updates.\nOriginal Text:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThe parameter update vector of Adagrad that we derived previously thus takes the form:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nWe now simply replace the diagonal matrix G t with the decaying average over past squared gradients E [ g 2 ] t :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nAs the denominator is just the root mean squared (RMS) error criterion of the gradient, we can replace it with the criterion short-hand:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThe authors note that the units in this update (as well as in SGD, Momentum, or Adagrad) do not match, i.e. the update should have the same hypothetical units as the parameter. To realize this, they first define another exponentially decaying average, this time not of squared gradients but of squared parameter updates:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThe root mean squared error of parameter updates is thus:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nContextualized Text:\nBuilding upon Adagrad, Adadelta aims to mitigate its aggressive learning rate by replacing the diagonal matrix of accumulated squared gradients with a decaying average of past squared gradients. To address discrepancies in units between the update and the parameter, an exponentially decaying average of squared parameter updates is introduced. This allows for a more refined adjustment to the model's parameters.	{"tags": ["optimization", "deep-learning", "algorithm"], "doc_id": "af81f2c0-d5f6-4045-bfb1-c935cb940555", "summary": "Adadelta modifies the Adagrad update rule by replacing the diagonal matrix of accumulated squared gradients with a decaying average of past squared gradients, and addresses unit inconsistencies by introducing a decaying average of squared parameter updates.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": [], "keywords": ["Adadelta", "Adagrad", "parameter updates", "squared gradients", "root mean squared error", "RMS"], "key_objects": ["Adagrad", "Parameter Updates", "Squared Gradients", "RMS Error"], "contextual_text": "Building upon Adagrad, Adadelta aims to mitigate its aggressive learning rate by replacing the diagonal matrix of accumulated squared gradients with a decaying average of past squared gradients.

Adadelta, root mean squared error, parameter updates, learning rate\nKey Objects: parameter updates, learning rate, Adadelta update rule\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is it beneficial to eliminate the need for a default learning rate?\n- How does approximating RMS[∆ θ ] t with RMS[∆ θ ] t -1 affect the training process?\n- What are the potential advantages of using Adadelta compared to algorithms that require a manually tuned learning rate?\n---\nSummary:\nAdadelta eliminates the need for a default learning rate by approximating the root mean squared error of parameter updates with values from the previous time step.\nOriginal Text:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThe root mean squared error of parameter updates is thus:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nSince RMS [∆ θ ] t is unknown, we approximate it with the RMS of parameter updates until the previous time step. Replacing the learning rate η in the previous update rule with RMS [∆ θ ] t -1 finally yields the Adadelta update rule:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nWith Adadelta, we do not even need to set a default learning rate, as it has been eliminated from the update rule.\nContextualized Text:\nTo address limitations in previous optimization algorithms, Adadelta approximates the root mean squared error of parameter updates using the root mean squared error from the previous time step.

adaptive learning rate, RMSprop, Adagrad, learning rates\nKey Objects: RMSprop, learning rates, Adagrad\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What problem does RMSprop aim to solve?\n- How does RMSprop relate to Adagrad and Adadelta?\n- Why is an adaptive learning rate beneficial?\n---\nSummary:\nRMSprop is an adaptive learning rate method proposed by Geoff Hinton to address the issues with Adagrad's decreasing learning rates.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.5 RMSprop  \nRMSprop is an unpublished, adaptive learning rate method proposed by Geoff Hinton in Lecture 6e of his Coursera Class 12 .  \nRMSprop and Adadelta have both been developed independently around the same time stemming from the need to resolve Adagrad's radically diminishing learning rates. RMSprop in fact is identical to the first update vector of Adadelta that we derived above:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nRMSprop as well divides the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients. Hinton suggests γ to be set to 0 . 9 , while a good default value for the learning rate η is 0 . 001 .\nContextualized Text:\nRMSprop is an adaptive learning rate method, proposed by Geoff Hinton in a Coursera lecture.

adaptive learning rates, parameter updates, bias correction, empirical performance\nKey Objects: parameters, gradients, estimates\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does Adam's use of bias correction improve upon previous adaptive learning methods?\n- What is the significance of the default values proposed for β 1 , β 2, and epsilon?\n- In what scenarios might Adam be preferred over other adaptive learning algorithms?\n---\nSummary:\nAdam utilizes bias-corrected estimates of past gradients and squared gradients to update parameters, similar to Adadelta and RMSprop, and demonstrates strong empirical performance compared to other adaptive learning methods.\nOriginal Text:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \n12 http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture\\_slides\\_lec6.pdf  \nThey then use these to update the parameters just as we have seen in Adadelta and RMSprop, which yields the Adam update rule:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThe authors propose default values of 0 . 9 for β 1 , 0 . 999 for β 2 , and 10 -8 for glyph[epsilon1] . They show empirically that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other adaptive learning-method algorithms.\nContextualized Text:\nAdaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter by storing exponentially decaying averages of past gradients. Adam uses bias-corrected estimates of past gradients and squared gradients to update parameters, similar to Adadelta and RMSprop. The authors propose default values for parameters like β 1 and β 2, and demonstrate empirically that Adam performs well compared to other adaptive learning methods.	{"tags": ["optimization", "deep-learning", "algorithms"], "doc_id": "b7e3d153-6f60-4e60-abb7-3b86827a2d47", "summary": "Adam utilizes bias-corrected estimates of past gradients and squared gradients to update parameters, similar to Adadelta and RMSprop, and demonstrates strong empirical performance compared to other adaptive learning methods.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Adam", "Adadelta", "RMSprop"], "keywords": ["adaptive learning rates", "parameter updates", "bias correction", "empirical performance"], "key_objects": ["parameters", "gradients", "estimates"], "contextual_text": "Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter by storing exponentially decaying averages of past gradients.

Adam, AdaMax, optimization, infinity norm, update rule\nKey Objects: AdaMax, infinity norm, update rule, Adam\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why are large p values in the glyph[lscript] p norm problematic for optimization?\n- How does using the infinity norm in AdaMax contribute to greater numerical stability?\n- What is the purpose of introducing 'u t' and how does it differ from the traditional 'v t' in Adam?\n---\nSummary:\nAdaMax is a modification of the Adam optimization algorithm that utilizes the infinity norm (glyph[lscript] ∞) to create a more stable update rule by replacing √ ˆ v t + glyph[epsilon1] with u t.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.7 AdaMax  \nThe v t factor in the Adam update rule scales the gradient inversely proportionally to the glyph[lscript] 2 norm of the past gradients (via the v t -1 term) and current gradient | g t | 2 :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nWe can generalize this update to the glyph[lscript] p norm. Note that Kingma and Ba also parameterize β 2 as β p 2 :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nNorms for large p values generally become numerically unstable, which is why glyph[lscript] 1 and glyph[lscript] 2 norms are most common in practice. However, glyph[lscript] ∞ also generally exhibits stable behavior. For this reason, the authors propose AdaMax [10] and show that v t with glyph[lscript] ∞ converges to the following more stable value. To avoid confusion with Adam, we use u t to denote the infinity norm-constrained v t :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nWe can now plug this into the Adam update equation by replacing √ ˆ v t + glyph[epsilon1] with u t to obtain the AdaMax update rule:\nContextualized Text:\nIn the Adam optimization algorithm, the 'v t' factor initially scales gradients based on the glyph[lscript] 2 norm. AdaMax is a modification that generalizes this to the glyph[lscript] p norm, recognizing that large p values can lead to numerical instability. To create a more stable update rule, AdaMax utilizes the infinity norm (glyph[lscript] ∞) and replaces √ ˆ v t + glyph[epsilon1] with u t.	{"tags": ["optimization", "deep-learning", "algorithm", "stability"], "doc_id": "741c1f63-2f48-4b1b-85be-2948173649bd", "summary": "AdaMax is a modification of the Adam optimization algorithm that utilizes the infinity norm (glyph[lscript] ∞) to create a more stable update rule by replacing √ ˆ v t + glyph[epsilon1] with u t.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Kingma", "Ba"], "keywords": ["Adam", "AdaMax", "optimization", "infinity norm", "update rule"], "key_objects": ["AdaMax", "infinity norm", "update rule", "Adam"], "contextual_text": "In the Adam optimization algorithm, the 'v t' factor initially scales gradients based on the glyph[lscript] 2 norm.

AdaMax, infinity norm, bias correction, Adam update\nKey Objects: AdaMax update rule, infinity norm, bias correction\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the infinity norm constrain the update differently than Adam's approach?\n- Why is the bias towards zero problematic in the Adam update?\n- What are the advantages of using AdaMax over standard Adam?\n---\nSummary:\nThe AdaMax update rule is derived by substituting u_t, representing the infinity norm-constrained v_t, into the Adam update equation, and it avoids the need for a bias correction due to its reliance on a max operation.\nOriginal Text:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nWe can now plug this into the Adam update equation by replacing √ ˆ v t + glyph[epsilon1] with u t to obtain the AdaMax update rule:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nNote that as u t relies on the max operation, it is not as suggestible to bias towards zero as m t and v t in Adam, which is why we do not need to compute a bias correction for u t . Good default values are again η = 0 . 002 , β 1 = 0 . 9 , and β 2 = 0 . 999 .\nContextualized Text:\nTo derive the AdaMax update rule, researchers substituted u_t, which is a value representing the infinity norm-constrained v_t, into the Adam update equation.

Nadam, Adam, NAG, momentum, optimization, gradient descent\nKey Objects: Nadam, momentum term, gradient\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are the core advantages of combining Adam and NAG?\n- How does Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) improve upon vanilla momentum?\n- What is the significance of modifying the momentum term, m t , in the Nadam update rule?\n---\nSummary:\nNadam is an optimization algorithm that combines Adam and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) to leverage the benefits of both approaches.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.8 Nadam  \nAs we have seen before, Adam can be viewed as a combination of RMSprop and momentum: RMSprop contributes the exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients v t , while momentum accounts for the exponentially decaying average of past gradients m t . We have also seen that Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) is superior to vanilla momentum.  \nNadam (Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation) [7] thus combines Adam and NAG. In order to incorporate NAG into Adam, we need to modify its momentum term m t .  \nFirst, let us recall the momentum update rule using our current notation :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nwhere J is our objective function, γ is the momentum decay term, and η is our step size. Expanding the third equation above yields:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThis demonstrates again that momentum involves taking a step in the direction of the previous momentum vector and a step in the direction of the current gradient.\nContextualized Text:\nNadam is an optimization algorithm designed to improve upon Adam by incorporating aspects of Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG). NAG offers a more accurate step direction by updating parameters before computing the gradient. To implement Nadam, the momentum term, m t , within Adam is modified.	{"tags": ["optimization", "deep-learning", "algorithm"], "doc_id": "7c901422-29b7-4eed-9b97-79e73df1370c", "summary": "Nadam is an optimization algorithm that combines Adam and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) to leverage the benefits of both approaches.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Adam", "NAG", "RMSprop"], "keywords": ["Nadam", "Adam", "NAG", "momentum", "optimization", "gradient descent"], "key_objects": ["Nadam", "momentum term", "gradient"], "contextual_text": "Nadam is an optimization algorithm designed to improve upon Adam by incorporating aspects of Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG).

momentum, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient, NAG, gradient descent, parameter update\nKey Objects: momentum, gradient, parameters\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does NAG improve upon standard momentum?\n- What is the advantage of applying the look-ahead momentum vector directly to update parameters?\n- Could this look-ahead approach be applied to other optimization algorithms?\n---\nSummary:\nNesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) enhances momentum by updating parameters with a momentum step before calculating the gradient, and Dozat proposes applying the look-ahead momentum vector directly to update parameters.\nOriginal Text:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThis demonstrates again that momentum involves taking a step in the direction of the previous momentum vector and a step in the direction of the current gradient.  \nNAG then allows us to perform a more accurate step in the gradient direction by updating the parameters with the momentum step before computing the gradient. We thus only need to modify the gradient g t to arrive at NAG:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nDozat proposes to modify NAG the following way: Rather than applying the momentum step twice one time for updating the gradient g t and a second time for updating the parameters θ t +1 - we now apply the look-ahead momentum vector directly to update the current parameters:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nContextualized Text:\nTo improve upon standard momentum, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) calculates a more accurate step by first updating the parameters with a momentum step and *then* computing the gradient.

Nadam, Adam, Nesterov momentum, momentum vector, parameter updates\nKey Objects: momentum vector, parameter updates, Adam update rule\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is the advantage of using the current momentum vector instead of the previous one in Nadam?\n- How does Nadam build upon the principles of both Adam and Nesterov accelerated gradient?\n- What is the role of the bias-corrected estimate of the momentum vector in the Nadam update rule?\n---\nSummary:\nNadam incorporates Nesterov momentum into the Adam optimization algorithm by replacing the previous momentum vector with the current momentum vector to improve the accuracy of parameter updates.\nOriginal Text:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nNotice that rather than utilizing the previous momentum vector m t -1 as in Equation 27, we now use the current momentum vector m t to look ahead. In order to add Nesterov momentum to Adam, we can thus similarly replace the previous momentum vector with the current momentum vector. First, recall that the Adam update rule is the following (note that we do not need to modify ˆ v t ):  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nExpanding the second equation with the definitions of ˆ m t and m t in turn gives us:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nNote that β 1 m t -1 1 -β t 1 is just the bias-corrected estimate of the momentum vector of the previous time step. We can thus replace it with ˆ m t -1 :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nContextualized Text:\nTo create Nadam, an optimization algorithm combining Adam and Nesterov accelerated gradient, the previous momentum vector in Adam's update rule is replaced with the current momentum vector.

Nadam, momentum vector, bias correction, optimization\nKey Objects: momentum vector, bias correction\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is the purpose of bias correction in the momentum vector?\n- How does replacing ˆ m t -1 with ˆ m t contribute to the Nadam update rule?\n- In what way does Nadam improve upon the Adam optimization algorithm?\n---\nSummary:\nTo derive the Nadam update rule, the bias-corrected estimate of the previous momentum vector (ˆ m t -1 ) can be replaced with the bias-corrected estimate of the current momentum vector (ˆ m t ).\nOriginal Text:\nNote that β 1 m t -1 1 -β t 1 is just the bias-corrected estimate of the momentum vector of the previous time step. We can thus replace it with ˆ m t -1 :  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThis equation looks very similar to our expanded momentum term in Equation 27. We can now add Nesterov momentum just as we did in Equation 29 by simply replacing this bias-corrected estimate of the momentum vector of the previous time step ˆ m t -1 with the bias-corrected estimate of the current momentum vector ˆ m t , which gives us the Nadam update rule:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nContextualized Text:\nAs part of the Nadam optimization algorithm, which combines Adam and Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG), a step involves incorporating a bias-corrected estimate of the momentum vector.

optimization algorithms, loss surface, Beale function, momentum, NAG\nKey Objects: optimization algorithms, loss surface, momentum, NAG\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why were Momentum and NAG initially led off-track?\n- What does it mean for an algorithm to 'converge similarly fast'?\n- How does NAG's responsiveness contribute to its ability to correct its course?\n---\nSummary:\nTwo figures illustrate the optimization behavior of different algorithms, showing their paths on a loss surface and at a saddle point, providing intuition for their performance.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.9 Visualization of algorithms  \nThe following two figures provide some intuitions towards the optimization behaviour of the presented optimization algorithms. 13  \nIn Figure 4a, we see the path they took on the contours of a loss surface (the Beale function). All started at the same point and took different paths to reach the minimum. Note that Adagrad, Adadelta, and RMSprop headed off immediately in the right direction and converged similarly fast, while Momentum and NAG were led off-track, evoking the image of a ball rolling down the hill. NAG, however, was able to correct its course sooner due to its increased responsiveness by looking ahead and headed to the minimum.\nContextualized Text:\nTo provide intuition towards the optimization behavior of algorithms like Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, Momentum, and NAG, Figure 4a visualizes the paths they took on the contours of a loss surface, specifically the Beale function.

./images/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms/image_4.png, ./images/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms/image_5.png\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why do algorithms like SGD, Momentum, and NAG have difficulty escaping a saddle point?\n- How do adaptive learning-rate methods like Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adadelta outperform others at saddle points?\n- What is the significance of the 'symmetry' issue mentioned in relation to saddle points and optimization algorithms?\n---\nSummary:\nFigure 4b illustrates how different optimization algorithms behave when encountering a saddle point, where gradients have opposing slopes, posing a challenge for standard SGD.\nOriginal Text:\nFigure 4b shows the behaviour of the algorithms at a saddle point, i.e. a point where one dimension has a positive slope, while the other dimension has a negative slope, which pose a difficulty for SGD as we mentioned before. Notice here that SGD, Momentum, and NAG find it difficulty to break symmetry, although the latter two eventually manage to escape the saddle point, while Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adadelta quickly head down the negative slope, with Adadelta leading the charge.  \n  \n(a) SGD optimization on loss surface contours  \n  \n(b) SGD optimization on saddle point  \nFigure 4: Source and full animations: Alec Radford  \nAs we can see, the adaptive learning-rate methods, i.e. Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam are most suitable and provide the best convergence for these scenarios.\nContextualized Text:\nFigure 4b demonstrates the behavior of optimization algorithms, such as SGD, Momentum, and NAG, when facing a saddle point – a location with opposing gradient slopes.

title: Optimization Algorithms on a Loss Landscape\nTags: optimization, machine-learning, loss-landscape, sgd, momentum, nag, adagrad, adadelta, rmsprop\nKey objects: Loss Landscape, Contour Lines, SGD Path, Momentum Path, NAG Path, Adagrad Path, Adadelta Path, RMSprop Path, Local Minima, Global Minimum\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates the paths taken by different optimization algorithms on a loss landscape, represented by a series of contour lines. The image compares SGD, Momentum, NAG, Adagrad, Adadelta, and RMSprop, showing how each algorithm navigates the landscape to minimize the loss.\nFull description:\nThe image depicts a loss landscape with contour lines representing equal loss values. Several algorithms are visualized by their paths through this landscape. The 'SGD' path (red) demonstrates a relatively straightforward, albeit potentially slow, descent. The 'Momentum' path (purple) shows an accelerated descent, particularly in areas with varying slopes. 'NAG' (dark purple) has a similar accelerated approach. The 'Adagrad' path (blue) is shown as gradually approaching the minimum. Similarly, the 'Adadelta' path (cyan) demonstrates a slow but steady trajectory. Finally, the 'RMSprop' path (green) shows an accelerated approach toward the minimum. The landscape has both local minima and a global minimum at the center.\nText found in image:\n- SGD\n- Momentum\n- NAG\n- Adagrad\n- Adadelta\n- RMSprop	{"tags": ["optimization", "machine-learning", "loss-landscape", "sgd", "momentum", "nag", "adagrad", "adadelta", "rmsprop"], "title": "Optimization Algorithms on a Loss Landscape", "doc_id": "36067d30-cffc-47cd-8fb6-04e70c9b42fb", "source": "./images/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms/image_4.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates the paths taken by different optimization algorithms on a loss landscape, represented by a series of contour lines.

title: Optimization Algorithms on a Loss Surface\nTags: optimization, gradient-descent, machine-learning, neural-networks, loss-surface, algorithm\nKey objects: Loss Surface, SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), Momentum, NAG (Nesterov Accelerated Gradient), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates the paths taken by different optimization algorithms as they navigate a 3D loss surface, attempting to reach the global minimum. Each algorithm’s trajectory is visualized as a line on the surface, demonstrating their varying approaches to gradient descent.\nFull description:\nThe diagram shows a 3D loss surface, which is represented as a colored landscape. Several algorithms are visualized as paths on this surface, demonstrating how they attempt to find the lowest point (minimum loss). 'SGD' follows a zigzag path directly down the surface. 'Momentum' builds on 'SGD' by continuing its movement based on its past movement, resulting in a less erratic path. 'NAG' takes a similar approach to 'Momentum' but corrects its direction slightly by looking ahead at the gradient. 'Adagrad' adjusts the learning rate based on past gradients, and this is reflected in its path. 'Adadelta' is a variant of 'Adagrad' and has a similar trajectory. 'RMSprop' adapts the learning rate by tracking the exponentially decaying average of squared gradients, leading to a different path on the surface.\nText found in image:\n- SGD\n- Momentum\n- NAG (Nesterov Accelerated Gradient)\n- Adagrad\n- Adadelta\n- RMSprop	{"tags": ["optimization", "gradient-descent", "machine-learning", "neural-networks", "loss-surface", "algorithm"], "title": "Optimization Algorithms on a Loss Surface", "doc_id": "66c454db-890f-451c-a568-54ae9008e9da", "source": "./images/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms/image_5.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates the paths taken by different optimization algorithms as they navigate a 3D loss surface, attempting to reach the global minimum.

adaptive learning rate, sparse data, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adadelta, Adam, optimization\nKey Objects: optimizers, sparse data, learning rate, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adadelta, Adam\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why are adaptive learning rate methods often preferred for sparse data?\n- How does Adam improve upon RMSprop, and why might it be the best overall choice?\n- What is the primary difference between RMSprop and Adadelta?\n---\nSummary:\nWhen dealing with sparse input data, adaptive learning-rate methods are often the best choice for optimizers, offering good results without extensive learning rate tuning.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.10 Which optimizer to use?  \nSo, which optimizer should you use? If your input data is sparse, then you likely achieve the best results using one of the adaptive learning-rate methods. An additional benefit is that you will not need to tune the learning rate but will likely achieve the best results with the default value.  \nIn summary, RMSprop is an extension of Adagrad that deals with its radically diminishing learning rates. It is identical to Adadelta, except that Adadelta uses the RMS of parameter updates in the numerator update rule. Adam, finally, adds bias-correction and momentum to RMSprop. Insofar, RMSprop, Adadelta, and Adam are very similar algorithms that do well in similar circumstances. Kingma et al. [10] show that its bias-correction helps Adam slightly outperform RMSprop towards the end of optimization as gradients become sparser. Insofar, Adam might be the best overall choice.\nContextualized Text:\nWhen choosing an optimizer, adaptive learning-rate methods like RMSprop, Adadelta, and Adam are often preferred, especially when the input data is sparse. RMSprop is an extension of Adagrad that addresses diminishing learning rates, while Adadelta is similar except for how it calculates parameter updates. Adam incorporates bias correction and momentum, potentially leading to slightly better performance towards the end of optimization compared to RMSprop. These optimizers often provide good results without the need to manually tune the learning rate.	{"tags": ["optimization", "deep-learning", "algorithms"], "doc_id": "cd33c731-a1fe-4685-87f9-ea8468725c09", "summary": "When dealing with sparse input data, adaptive learning-rate methods are often the best choice for optimizers, offering good results without extensive learning rate tuning.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Adam", "RMSprop", "Adagrad", "Adadelta", "Kingma et al."], "keywords": ["adaptive learning rate", "sparse data", "RMSprop", "Adagrad", "Adadelta", "Adam", "optimization"], "key_objects": ["optimizers", "sparse data", "learning rate", "RMSprop", "Adagrad", "Adadelta", "Adam"], "contextual_text": "When choosing an optimizer, adaptive learning-rate methods like RMSprop, Adadelta, and Adam are often preferred, especially when the input data is sparse.

vanilla SGD, learning rate annealing, adaptive learning rate methods, convergence\nKey Objects: SGD, adaptive learning rate methods, minimum\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why might SGD get stuck in saddle points?\n- What does it mean for an SGD schedule to be 'robust'?\n- In what scenarios might using vanilla SGD be a viable option despite its slower convergence?\n---\nSummary:\nWhile SGD can find a minimum, it typically requires more time and careful tuning compared to adaptive learning rate methods.\nOriginal Text:\nInterestingly, many recent papers use vanilla SGD without momentum and a simple learning rate annealing schedule. As has been shown, SGD usually achieves to find a minimum, but it might take significantly longer than with some of the optimizers, is much more reliant on a robust initialization and annealing schedule, and may get stuck in saddle points rather than local minima. Consequently, if you care about fast convergence and train a deep or complex neural network, you should choose one of the adaptive learning rate methods.  \n13 Also have a look at http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/ for a description of the same images by Karpathy and another concise overview of the algorithms discussed.\nContextualized Text:\nInterestingly, recent papers often utilize vanilla SGD with a simple learning rate annealing schedule. While SGD is capable of finding a minimum, it generally takes significantly longer than adaptive learning rate optimizers, necessitates a robust initialization and learning rate schedule, and is prone to getting stuck in saddle points instead of local minima. Therefore, for faster convergence when training complex neural networks, adaptive learning rate methods are typically preferred.	{"tags": ["optimization", "deep-learning", "SGD", "convergence"], "doc_id": "0833e719-8d42-4942-aede-738c13a959bb", "summary": "While SGD can find a minimum, it typically requires more time and careful tuning compared to adaptive learning rate methods.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": [], "keywords": ["vanilla SGD", "learning rate annealing", "adaptive learning rate methods", "convergence"], "key_objects": ["SGD", "adaptive learning rate methods", "minimum"], "contextual_text": "Interestingly, recent papers often utilize vanilla SGD with a simple learning rate annealing schedule.

computing clusters.\nOriginal Text:\n## 5 Parallelizing and distributing SGD  \nGiven the ubiquity of large-scale data solutions and the availability of low-commodity clusters, distributing SGD to speed it up further is an obvious choice. SGD by itself is inherently sequential: Step-by-step, we progress further towards the minimum. Running it provides good convergence but can be slow particularly on large datasets. In contrast, running SGD asynchronously is faster, but suboptimal communication between workers can lead to poor convergence. Additionally, we can also parallelize SGD on one machine without the need for a large computing cluster. The following are algorithms and architectures that have been proposed to optimize parallelized and distributed SGD.\nContextualized Text:\nTo accelerate training on large datasets, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) can be distributed across multiple machines or parallelized on a single machine.  Because SGD is inherently sequential, standard implementations can be slow. Distributing or parallelizing SGD is an obvious choice given the widespread availability of commodity computing clusters.	{"tags": ["optimization", "parallelism", "distributed computing"], "doc_id": "4362f5ec-ca19-4530-bf1c-6b62baf2a67d", "summary": "Distributing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a common approach to accelerate training, especially with large datasets and readily available computing clusters.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": [], "keywords": ["Stochastic Gradient Descent", "SGD", "parallelizing", "distributing", "large datasets"], "key_objects": ["Stochastic Gradient Descent", "SGD", "computing clusters"], "contextual_text": "To accelerate training on large datasets, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) can be distributed across multiple machines or parallelized on a single machine.

parallel SGD, Hogwild!, shared memory, sparse data, update scheme\nKey Objects: Hogwild!, shared memory, parameters, processors\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is sparse data a requirement for the Hogwild! update scheme?\n- What is the advantage of allowing processors to access shared memory without locking parameters?\n- How does Hogwild! compare to traditional parallel SGD methods that use parameter locking?\n---\nSummary:\nNiu et al. introduced Hogwild!, an update scheme that enables parallel SGD updates on CPUs by allowing processors to access shared memory without parameter locking.\nOriginal Text:\n### 5.1 Hogwild!  \nNiu et al. [15] introduce an update scheme called Hogwild! that allows performing SGD updates in parallel on CPUs. Processors are allowed to access shared memory without locking the parameters. This only works if the input data is sparse, as each update will only modify a fraction of all parameters. They show that in this case, the update scheme achieves almost an optimal rate of convergence, as it is unlikely that processors will overwrite useful information.\nContextualized Text:\nTo enable parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) updates on CPUs, Niu et al. introduced Hogwild!, an update scheme that allows processors to access shared memory without parameter locking. This method is effective when the input data is sparse, as it ensures that each update only modifies a small fraction of the overall parameters, preventing processors from overwriting valuable information and achieving a near-optimal convergence rate.	{"tags": ["optimization", "parallelism", "SGD"], "doc_id": "354f6e50-1d7a-4db5-a888-0fec221054dc", "summary": "Niu et al. introduced Hogwild!, an update scheme that enables parallel SGD updates on CPUs by allowing processors to access shared memory without parameter locking.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Niu", "SGD"], "keywords": ["parallel SGD", "Hogwild!", "shared memory", "sparse data", "update scheme"], "key_objects": ["Hogwild!", "shared memory", "parameters", "processors"], "contextual_text": "To enable parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) updates on CPUs, Niu et al. introduced Hogwild!, an update scheme that allows processors to access shared memory without parameter locking.

Text:\n### 5.2 Downpour SGD  \nDownpour SGD is an asynchronous variant of SGD that was used by Dean et al. [6] in their DistBelief framework (the predecessor to TensorFlow) at Google. It runs multiple replicas of a model in parallel on subsets of the training data. These models send their updates to a parameter server, which is split across many machines. Each machine is responsible for storing and updating a fraction of the model's parameters. However, as replicas don't communicate with each other e.g. by sharing weights or updates, their parameters are continuously at risk of diverging, hindering convergence.\nContextualized Text:\nDownpour SGD is an asynchronous variant of SGD that was used in Google’s DistBelief framework, which preceded TensorFlow.  It involves running multiple copies (replicas) of a model in parallel on different subsets of the training data. These model replicas send their updates to a parameter server, which is distributed across multiple machines, each responsible for managing a portion of the model’s parameters.  A key challenge with this approach is that, due to the lack of communication between the replicas, their parameters are at risk of diverging, potentially hindering the overall convergence of the model.	{"tags": ["optimization", "distributed computing", "deep learning", "SGD"], "doc_id": "0bc35fe9-9dbb-438e-a6d7-5cbb0d985dea", "summary": "Downpour SGD is an asynchronous variant of SGD used in Google’s DistBelief framework (a predecessor to TensorFlow) that utilizes multiple model replicas running in parallel on subsets of training data.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["DistBelief", "TensorFlow", "Google"], "keywords": ["asynchronous SGD", "parallel computing", "parameter server", "model replicas", "training data"], "key_objects": ["model replicas", "parameter server", "training data", "model parameters"], "contextual_text": "Downpour SGD is an asynchronous variant of SGD that was used in Google’s DistBelief framework, which preceded TensorFlow.

It is based on their experience with DistBelief and is already used internally to perform computations on a large range of mobile devices as well as on large-scale distributed systems. The distributed version, which was released in April 2016 15 relies on a computation graph that is split into a subgraph for every device, while communication takes place using Send/Receive node pairs.\nContextualized Text:\nTensorFlow is Google's recently open-sourced framework for the implementation and deployment of large-scale machine learning models. It's based on Google's previous work with DistBelief and is used internally for computations across mobile devices and large distributed systems.  A distributed version, released in April 2016, utilizes a computation graph divided into subgraphs for each device, with communication handled via Send/Receive node pairs.	{"tags": ["deep-learning", "framework", "TensorFlow"], "doc_id": "69561b40-0711-442b-8bc8-cd9cc3b737cb", "summary": "TensorFlow is Google's open-sourced framework, built upon DistBelief, used for implementing and deploying large-scale machine learning models.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Google", "DistBelief"], "keywords": ["machine learning models", "TensorFlow", "large-scale deployment", "framework"], "key_objects": ["TensorFlow", "framework", "machine learning models"], "contextual_text": "TensorFlow is Google's recently open-sourced framework for the implementation and deployment of large-scale machine learning models.

self-attention, masked self-attention, cross-attention, queries, keys, values\nKey Objects: Attention Mechanisms, Queries, Keys, Values\nRefers to Images: ./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_1.png\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is the purpose of masking self-attention in the decoder?\n- How does cross-attention facilitate communication between the encoder and decoder?\n- What is the significance of using Queries, Keys and Values in the attention mechanism?\n---\nSummary:\nThe vanilla Transformer utilizes three distinct types of attention mechanisms: self-attention (in the encoder), masked self-attention (in the decoder), and cross-attention (between encoder and decoder).\nOriginal Text:\nFig. 1. Overview of vanilla Transformer architecture  \n  \nIn Transformer, there are three types of attention in terms of the source of queries and key-value pairs:  \n- · Self-attention . In Transformer encoder, we set Q = K = V = X in Eq. (2), where X is the outputs of the previous layer.\n- · Masked Self-attention . In the Transformer decoder, the self-attention is restricted such that queries at each position can only attend to all key-value pairs up to and including that position. To enable parallel training, this is typically done by applying a mask function to the unnormalized attention matrix A = exp( ∇ D k $\\_{T}$) , where the illegal positions are masked out by setting ∆$\\_{ij}$ = -∞ if i\n- · Cross-attention . The queries are projected from the outputs of the previous (decoder) layer, whereas the keys and values are projected using the outputs of the encoder.\nContextualized Text:\nThe vanilla Transformer architecture employs several attention mechanisms to process sequential data.

Elastic Averaging SGD, EASGD, asynchronous SGD, parameter server, local optima\nKey Objects: parameters, workers, local variables, parameter space, local optima\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does EASGD differ from standard asynchronous SGD?\n- What is the role of the parameter server in EASGD?\n- Why would allowing local variables to fluctuate further improve

on the parameter server.\nOriginal Text:\n### 5.5 Elastic Averaging SGD  \nZhang et al. [23] propose Elastic Averaging SGD (EASGD), which links the parameters of the workers of asynchronous SGD with an elastic force, i.e. a center variable stored by the parameter server. This allows the local variables to fluctuate further from the center variable, which in theory allows for more exploration of the parameter space. They show empirically that this increased capacity for exploration leads to improved performance by finding new local optima.\nContextualized Text:\nIn the context of asynchronous SGD, Zhang et al. proposed Elastic Averaging SGD (EASGD) to improve parameter optimization.

can sometimes improve performance by presenting examples in a meaningful order.\nOriginal Text:\n### 6.1 Shuffling and Curriculum Learning  \nGenerally, we want to avoid providing the training examples in a meaningful order to our model as this may bias the optimization algorithm. Consequently, it is often a good idea to shuffle the training data after every epoch.  \nOn the other hand, for some cases where we aim to solve progressively harder problems, supplying the training examples in a meaningful order may actually lead to improved performance and better convergence. The method for establishing this meaningful order is called Curriculum Learning [3].  \nZaremba and Sutskever [21] were only able to train LSTMs to evaluate simple programs using Curriculum Learning and show that a combined or mixed strategy is better than the naive one, which sorts examples by increasing difficulty.\nContextualized Text:\nDuring training, it's often beneficial to avoid presenting training examples in a specific order, as this can bias the optimization algorithm. Therefore, shuffling the training data after each epoch is generally recommended. However, in scenarios where progressively harder problems are targeted, supplying examples in a meaningful order—a technique known as curriculum learning—can sometimes lead to better performance and faster convergence.  Researchers Zaremba and Sutskever successfully trained LSTMs to evaluate simple programs using curriculum learning.	{"tags": ["optimization", "training", "machine learning"], "doc_id": "f6625cfd-0f0b-4b26-8d3e-ef20fa47a22c", "summary": "To prevent bias in the optimization algorithm, it's generally recommended to shuffle training data after each epoch, though curriculum learning can sometimes improve performance by presenting examples in a meaningful order.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["LSTMs"], "keywords": ["training data", "optimization algorithm", "curriculum learning", "shuffling", "epoch"], "key_objects": ["training examples", "optimization algorithm", "curriculum learning"], "contextual_text": "During training, it's often beneficial to avoid presenting training examples in a specific order, as this can bias the optimization algorithm.

batch normalization, parameter normalization, learning rates, Dropout\nKey Objects: parameters, mini-batch, learning rates, Dropout\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is it important to normalize the initial values of model parameters?\n- How does batch normalization improve training speed and stability?\n- What is the connection between batch normalization and the need for Dropout?\n---\nSummary:\nBatch normalization reestablishes parameter normalizations for every mini-batch, allowing for higher learning rates and reducing the need for Dropout.\nOriginal Text:\n### 6.2 Batch normalization  \nTo facilitate learning, we typically normalize the initial values of our parameters by initializing them with zero mean and unit variance. As training progresses and we update parameters to different extents, we lose this normalization, which slows down training and amplifies changes as the network becomes deeper.  \nBatch normalization [9] reestablishes these normalizations for every mini-batch and changes are backpropagated through the operation as well. By making normalization part of the model architecture, we are able to use higher learning rates and pay less attention to the initialization parameters. Batch normalization additionally acts as a regularizer, reducing (and sometimes even eliminating) the need for Dropout.\nContextualized Text:\nTo facilitate learning, it is typical to normalize initial parameter values with zero mean and unit variance. During training, this normalization is lost, which can slow down the process and amplify changes. Batch normalization reestablishes these normalizations for each mini-batch. This technique allows for the use of higher learning rates and reduces the need for Dropout, acting as a regularizer within the model architecture.	{"tags": ["optimization", "regularization", "deep learning"], "doc_id": "6091a521-62aa-47ff-ac8c-abb374aa0e34", "summary": "Batch normalization reestablishes parameter normalizations for every mini-batch, allowing for higher learning rates and reducing the need for Dropout.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": [], "keywords": ["batch normalization", "parameter normalization", "learning rates", "Dropout"], "key_objects": ["parameters", "mini-batch", "learning rates", "Dropout"], "contextual_text": "To facilitate learning, it is typical to normalize initial parameter values with zero mean and unit variance.

early stopping, validation set, training, optimization\nKey Objects: validation error, training process\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What does Geoff Hinton mean by 'beautiful free lunch' in the context of early stopping?\n- Why is it important to monitor error on a validation set during training?\n- What constitutes 'patience' when using early stopping?\n---\nSummary:\nEarly stopping, described by Geoff Hinton as a 'beautiful free lunch,' involves monitoring validation error during training and halting the process when improvement stagnates.\nOriginal Text:\n### 6.3 Early stopping  \nAccording to Geoff Hinton: 'Early stopping (is) beautiful free lunch' 16 . You should thus always monitor error on a validation set during training and stop (with some patience) if your validation error does not improve enough.\nContextualized Text:\nDuring training, it is recommended to use early stopping, a technique described by Geoff Hinton as a 'beautiful free lunch.'

gradient noise, Gaussian distribution, variance schedule, local minima\nKey Objects: gradient updates, variance, local minima, networks\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is

[13] proposed adding Gaussian noise to gradient updates, with a variance schedule, to improve network robustness and training, particularly for deep networks.\nOriginal Text:\n### 6.4 Gradient noise  \nNeelakantan et al. [13] add noise that follows a Gaussian distribution N (0 , σ 2 t ) to each gradient update:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThey anneal the variance according to the following schedule:  \n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->  \nThey show that adding this noise makes networks more robust to poor initialization and helps training particularly deep and complex networks. They suspect that the added noise gives the model more chances to escape and find new local minima, which are more frequent for deeper models.\nContextualized Text:\nTo enhance network robustness and training, particularly for deep and complex networks, Neelakantan et al. [13] introduced a technique called gradient noise. This method involves adding Gaussian noise, following a distribution N (0, σ²ᵗ), to each gradient update. The variance of this noise is annealed according to a specific schedule, providing the model with more opportunities to escape and discover new local minima.	{"tags": ["optimization", "deep learning", "robustness", "training"], "doc_id": "69d0ffbc-b22e-4ea6-8f04-3d9d816ea12d", "summary": "Neelakantan et al.

optimizing SGD?\n---\nSummary:\nThis article provides an overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms, covering variants of gradient descent, optimization algorithms for SGD (like Momentum and Adam), and strategies to improve SGD's performance.\nOriginal Text:\n## 7 Conclusion  \nIn this article, we have initially looked at the three variants of gradient descent, among which minibatch gradient descent is the most popular. We have then investigated algorithms that are most commonly used for optimizing SGD: Momentum, Nesterov accelerated gradient, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, Adam, AdaMax, Nadam, as well as different algorithms to optimize asynchronous SGD. Finally, we've considered other strategies to improve SGD such as shuffling and curriculum learning, batch normalization, and early stopping.  \n16 NIPS 2015 Tutorial slides, slide 63, http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/talks/ DL-Tutorial-NIPS2015.pdf\nContextualized Text:\nThis article concludes by summarizing the discussed gradient descent optimization algorithms.

Transformer, X-formers, variants, survey, literature review\nKey Objects: X-formers, variants\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is a survey of Transformer variants (X-formers) needed?\n- What are the key areas that this survey will cover regarding X-formers?\n- What distinguishes a 'vanilla' Transformer from its variants (X-formers)?\n---\nSummary:\nThis survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of Transformer variants (X-formers) due to their widespread success and the lack of a systematic literature review in the field.\nOriginal Text:\nTransformers have achieved great success in many artificial intelligence fields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. Therefore, it is natural to attract lots of interest from academic and industry researchers. Up to the present, a great variety of Transformer variants (a.k.a. X-formers) have been proposed, however, a systematic and comprehensive literature review on these Transformer variants is still missing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various X-formers. We first briefly introduce the vanilla Transformer and then propose a new taxonomy of X-formers. Next, we introduce the various X-formers from three perspectives: architectural modification, pre-training, and applications. Finally, we outline some potential directions for future research.  \nCCS Concepts: · General and reference → Surveys and overviews; · Computing methodologies → Artificial intelligence.\nContextualized Text:\nDue to their success in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing, Transformers have garnered significant interest from researchers. As a result, numerous Transformer variants, also known as X-formers, have emerged. This survey addresses the need for a comprehensive review of these X-formers, outlining their architectural modifications, pre-training techniques, and applications.	{"tags": ["survey", "deep-learning", "AI", "transformer"], "doc_id": "4f73b69a-54f8-4e7b-891a-26a7efcec584", "summary": "This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of Transformer variants (X-formers) due to their widespread success and the lack of a systematic literature review in the field.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["Transformer", "X-formers", "variants", "survey", "literature review"], "key_objects": ["X-formers", "variants"], "contextual_text": "Due to their success in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing, Transformers have garnered significant interest from researchers.

Language Processing and for pre-trained models.\nOriginal Text:\n## 1 INTRODUCTION  \nTransformer [137] is a prominent deep learning model that has been widely adopted in various fields, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV) and speech processing. Transformer was originally proposed as a sequence-to-sequence model [130] for machine translation. Later works show that Transformer-based pre-trained models (PTMs) [100] can achieve state-ofthe-art performances on various tasks. As a consequence, Transformer has become the go-to architecture in NLP, especially for PTMs. In addition to language related applications, Transformer has also been adopted in CV [13, 33, 94], audio processing [15, 31, 41] and even other disciplines, such as chemistry [114] and life sciences [109].  \nDue to the success, a variety of Transformer variants (a.k.a. X-formers) have been proposed over the past few years. These X-formers improve the vanilla Transformer from different perspectives.\nContextualized Text:\nOriginally proposed as a sequence-to-sequence model for machine translation, the Transformer has become a prominent deep learning model, widely adopted across various fields including natural language processing and computer vision.

Transformer, X-formers, model efficiency, model generalization, model adaptation\nKey Objects: X-formers, Self-attention module, Input data\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are some of the primary challenges that motivated the development of X-formers?\n- How does the ability of the Transformer to make few assumptions about input data impact its ability to generalize?\n- Can you provide examples of methods used to address each of the three areas: model efficiency, model generalization, and model adaptation?\n---\nSummary:\nFollowing the initial success of the Transformer model, numerous variants, referred to as X-formers, have emerged to enhance its capabilities. These improvements generally focus on three key areas: model efficiency, model generalization, and model adaptation.\nOriginal Text:\nDue to the success, a variety of Transformer variants (a.k.a. X-formers) have been proposed over the past few years. These X-formers improve the vanilla Transformer from different perspectives.  \n- (1) Model Efficiency. A key challenge of applying Transformer is its inefficiency at processing long sequences mainly due to the computation and memory complexity of the self-attention module. The improvement methods include lightweight attention (e.g. sparse attention variants) and Divide-and-conquer methods (e.g., recurrent and hierarchical mechanism).\n- (2) Model Generalization. Since the transformer is a flexible architecture and makes few assumptions on the structural bias of input data, it is hard to train on small-scale data. The improvement methods include introducing structural bias or regularization, pre-training on large-scale unlabeled data, etc.\n- (3) Model Adaptation. This line of work aims to adapt the Transformer to specific downstream tasks and applications.\nContextualized Text:\nDriven by the widespread adoption and success of the Transformer model, researchers have developed numerous variations, known as X-formers, to address specific limitations and broaden its applicability. These X-formers aim to improve upon the original Transformer's design, primarily focusing on making it more efficient, improving its ability to generalize with limited data, and adapting it to various downstream tasks.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "deep-learning", "transformer"], "doc_id": "a395f039-ef52-4e79-a966-dd6d32b27e53", "summary": "Following the initial success of the Transformer model, numerous variants, referred to as X-formers, have emerged to enhance its capabilities.

Transformer, X-formers, architecture modification, pre-training, applications, taxonomy\nKey Objects: Transformer variants, architecture, taxonomy\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are the three main categories used to classify Transformer variants?\n- Why is it helpful to categorize Transformer variants based on how they improve the original architecture?\n- How do these different categories of improvement reflect the challenges faced when applying Transformers?\n---\nSummary:\nExisting Transformer variants, often called X-formers, can be categorized by how they improve the original Transformer architecture, primarily through architecture modification, pre-training, and application-specific adaptations.\nOriginal Text:\nalleviate the overfitting problem on small datasets. Therefore, it is more methodical to categorize the various existing X-formers and propose a new taxonomy mainly according to their ways to improve the vanilla Transformer: architecture modification, pre-training, and applications. Considering the audience of this survey may be from different domains, we mainly focus on the general architecture variants and just briefly discuss the specific variants on pre-training and applications.\nContextualized Text:\nTo provide a structured understanding of Transformer variants (X-formers), this survey categorizes them based on their methods for improvement. These methods primarily fall into three categories: architecture modification, pre-training approaches, and adaptation to specific applications. This categorization will allow for a more methodical approach to understanding the diverse range of advancements built upon the original Transformer architecture.	{"tags": ["deep-learning", "NLP", "transformer", "survey"], "doc_id": "c1b691c5-b7d2-475c-bb8f-9d50cf8800e9", "summary": "Existing Transformer variants, often called X-formers, can be categorized by how they improve the original Transformer architecture, primarily through architecture modification, pre-training, and application-specific adaptations.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer", "X-formers"], "keywords": ["Transformer", "X-formers", "architecture modification", "pre-training", "applications", "taxonomy"], "key_objects": ["Transformer variants", "architecture", "taxonomy"], "contextual_text": "To provide a structured understanding of Transformer variants (X-formers), this survey categorizes them based on their methods for improvement.

BACKGROUND  \n### 2.1 Vanilla Transformer  \nThe vanilla Transformer [137] is a sequence-to-sequence model and consists of an encoder and a decoder, each of which is a stack of L identical blocks. Each encoder block is mainly composed of a multi-head self-attention module and a position-wise feed-forward network (FFN). For building a deeper model, a residual connection [49] is employed around each module, followed by Layer Normalization [4] module. Compared to the encoder blocks, decoder blocks additionally insert cross-attention modules between the multi-head self-attention modules and the position-wise FFNs. Furthermore, the self-attention modules in the decoder are adapted to prevent each position from attending to subsequent positions. The overall architecture of the vanilla Transformer is shown in Fig. 1.  \nIn the following subsection, we shall introduce the key modules of the vanilla Transformer.\nContextualized Text:\nThe vanilla Transformer, introduced in reference [137], is a sequence-to-sequence model designed for tasks involving both encoding and decoding sequences.

using Query-Key-Value pairs in the attention mechanism?\n- Why are the dot products of queries and keys divided by √ D_k?\n- How does the attention mechanism contribute to the overall functioning of

Query-Key-Value (QKV) models.\nOriginal Text:\nIn the following subsection, we shall introduce the key modules of the vanilla Transformer.  \n- 2.1.1 Attention Modules. Transformer adopts attention mechanism with Query-Key-Value (QKV) model. Given the packed matrix representations of queries Q ∈ R N × D$\\_{k}$ , keys K ∈ R M × D$\\_{k}$ , and values V ∈ R M × D$\\_{v}$ , the scaled dot-product attention used by Transformer is given by 1  \n$$A t t e n t i o n ( Q, K, V ) = s o f t m a x \\left ( \\frac { Q K ^ { T } } { \\sqrt { D _ { k } } } \\right ) V = A V,$$  \nwhere N and M denote the lengths of queries and keys (or values); D$\\_{k}$ and D$\\_{v}$ denote the dimensions of keys (or queries) and values; A = s o f t m a x ( QK T ) is often called attention matrix ; softmax is applied in a row-wise manner. The dot-products of queries and keys are divided by √ D$\\_{k}$ to alleviate gradient vanishing problem of the softmax function.\nContextualized Text:\nTo understand the vanilla Transformer model, it's important to review the model's key components. This section will begin by detailing the attention mechanism, which operates using a Query-Key-Value (QKV) model. This mechanism utilizes packed matrix representations of queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V) to calculate a scaled dot-product attention.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "attention"], "doc_id": "f57867ae-0b3c-4381-b38b-d1641e9db715", "summary": "The following section introduces the key modules used in the vanilla Transformer architecture, beginning with an explanation of the attention mechanism which utilizes Query-Key-Value (QKV) models.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["attention mechanism", "Query-Key-Value", "QKV", "scaled dot-product attention"], "key_objects": ["Attention Mechanism", "Query", "Key", "Value"], "contextual_text": "To understand the vanilla Transformer model, it's important to review the model's key components.

multi-head attention, queries, keys, values, learned projections\nKey Objects: Queries, Keys, Values, Multi-head Attention\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is it advantageous to project queries, keys, and values into different dimensions?\n- What is the purpose of the learned projections used in multi-head attention?\n- How does concatenating the outputs of the individual attention heads contribute to the model's overall performance?\n---\nSummary:\nTo enhance attention capabilities, the Transformer architecture employs multi-head attention, where queries, keys, and values are projected into different dimensions using learned projections, and the outputs are concatenated and projected back to the original dimension.\nOriginal Text:\nInstead of simply applying a single attention function, Transformer uses multi-head attention, where the D$\\_{m}$ GLYPH dimensional original queries, keys and values are projected into D$\\_{k}$ , D$\\_{k}$ and D$\\_{v}$ dimensions, respectively, with H di GLYPH erent sets of learned projections. For each of the projected queries, keys and values, and output is computed with attention according to Eq. (1). The model then concatenates all the outputs and projects them back to a D$\\_{m}$ GLYPH dimensional representation.  \n$$M u l t i H e a d A t t { \\mathcal { N } } ( Q, K, V ) = C o n a t { \\mathrm { c o a d } } { \\mathrm { h e a d } } ( 1, \\dots, h e a d _ { H } ) W ^ { O },$$  \n$$w h e r e \\, h a d _ { i } = A t t e n t i o n ( Q W ^ { O }, K W ^ { H }, V W ^ { I } ).$$  \n$^{1}$if not stated otherwise, we use row-major notations throughout this survey (e.g., the i -th row in Q is the query q$\\_{i}$ ) and all the vectors are row vectors by default.  \nFig. 1. Overview of vanilla Transformer architecture\nContextualized Text:\nInstead of applying a single attention function, the Transformer utilizes multi-head attention. In this approach, the original queries, keys, and values are projected into different dimensions using learned projections.  Each of these projected sets then undergoes an attention calculation (Eq. (1)), and the resulting outputs are concatenated and projected back to the original dimension.	{"tags": ["architecture", "attention", "transformer"], "doc_id": "121fda60-1994-4388-a82d-526129b3bde4", "summary": "To enhance attention capabilities, the Transformer architecture employs multi-head attention, where queries, keys, and values are projected into different dimensions using learned projections, and the outputs are concatenated and projected back to the original dimension.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["multi-head attention", "queries", "keys", "values", "learned projections"], "key_objects": ["Queries", "Keys", "Values", "Multi-head Attention"], "contextual_text": "Instead of applying a single attention function, the Transformer utilizes multi-head attention.

title: Transformer Architecture\nTags: transformer, neural-network, NLP, self-attention, architecture, encoder-decoder\nKey objects: Encoder Stack, Decoder Stack, Multi-Head Attention, Feed-Forward Network, Positional Encoding, Token Embedding, Linear Layer, Softmax Layer\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates the encoder-decoder architecture of a Transformer model. It showcases the flow of data through multiple encoder and decoder layers, highlighting the use of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks.\nFull description:\nThe diagram depicts the encoder-decoder structure of a Transformer model. On the left side, 'Inputs' are first transformed by a 'Token Embedding' layer and then combined with 'Positional Encoding'. This combined result is fed into an 'Nx' stack of encoder layers. Each encoder layer includes a 'Multi-Head Attention' sub-layer followed by an 'Add & Norm' layer and a 'Feed-Forward Network'.  On the right side, the diagram shows the decoder. The decoder starts with '(Masked) Multi-Head Attention' which attends to the previous decoder outputs, followed by an 'Add & Norm' layer.  The output of the decoder goes through a 'Multi-Head Attention' mechanism which attends to the encoder outputs, then to a 'Feed-Forward Network', a 'Linear' layer and finally a 'Softmax' layer to produce 'Output Probabilities'.\nText found in image:\n- Inputs\n- Token Embedding\n- Positional Encoding\n- Multi-Head Attention\n- Add & Norm\n- Feed-Forward Network\n- Outputs\n- Linear\n- Softmax\n- Output Probabilities\n- (Masked) Multi-Head Attention\n- Nx	{"tags": ["transformer", "neural-network", "NLP", "self-attention", "architecture", "encoder-decoder"], "title": "Transformer Architecture", "doc_id": "7a97f798-8aa4-452a-8aaa-862c64853369", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_1.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates the encoder-decoder architecture of a Transformer model.

cross-attention, position-wise FFN, encoder, decoder\nKey Objects: Cross-attention, Position-wise FFN, Queries, Keys, Values\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does cross-attention facilitate interaction between the encoder and decoder?\n- What is the purpose of applying the position-wise FFN to each position independently?\n- Why is the intermediate dimension (D_f) of the FFN typically larger than the model dimension (D_m)?\n---\nSummary:\nIn the Transformer architecture, cross-attention utilizes queries from the previous decoder layer and keys/values from the encoder layer, while the position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) is a fully connected module applied identically to each position.\nOriginal Text:\n- · Cross-attention . The queries are projected from the outputs of the previous (decoder) layer, whereas the keys and values are projected using the outputs of the encoder.\n- 2.1.2 Position-wise FFN . The position-wise FFN 3 is a fully connected feed-forward module that operates separately and identically on each position  \n$$F F N ( H ^ { \\prime } ) = R e L U ( H ^ { \\prime } W ^ { 1 } + b ^ { 1 } ) W ^ { 2 } + b ^ { 2 },$$  \n$^{2}$This term seems to be borrowed from the causal system , where the output depends on past and current inputs but not future inputs.  \n$^{3}$The parameters are shared across different positions, thus the position-wise FFN can also be understood as two convolution layers with kernel size of 1.  \nwhere H ' is the outputs of previous layer, and W 1 ∈$\\_{R}$ D$\\_{m}$ × D$\\_{f}$ , W 2 ∈$\\_{R}$ D$\\_{f}$ × D$\\_{m}$ , b 1 ∈$\\_{R}$ D$\\_{f}$ , b 2 ∈$\\_{R}$ D$\\_{m}$ are trainable parameters. Typically the intermediate dimension D$\\_{f}$ of the FFN is set to be larger than D$\\_{m}$ .\nContextualized Text:\nWithin the Transformer model, a crucial component is cross-attention, which distinguishes itself by sourcing queries from the outputs of the preceding decoder layer and utilizing keys and values projected from the encoder layer.

residual connection, layer normalization, Transformer, encoder block\nKey Objects: residual connection, layer normalization, encoder block, H', H\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is a residual connection necessary for training deep Transformer models?\n- What is the purpose of Layer Normalization in the Transformer architecture?\n- How do the equations for H' and H demonstrate the application of residual connections and Layer Normalization?\n---\nSummary:\nTo facilitate the training of deeper Transformer models, a residual connection is used around each module, followed by Layer Normalization, as exemplified by the equations for calculating H' and H within an encoder block.\nOriginal Text:\n2.1.3 Residual Connection and Normalization. In order to build a deep model, Transformer employs a residual connection [49] around each module, followed by Layer Normalization [4]. For instance, each Transformer encoder block may be written as  \n$$H ^ { \\prime } = \\, \\, L a y e r N o r m ( S e l f A t t e n t i o n ( X ) + X )$$  \n$$H = \\, \\, L a y e r N o r m ( F F N ( H ) ^ { \\prime } + H ^ { \\prime } ),$$  \nwhere SelfAttention() denotes self attention module and LayerNorm() denotes the layer normalization operation.  \n- 2.1.4 Position Encodings. Since Transformer doesn't introduce recurrence or convolution, it is ignorant of positional information (especially for the encoder). Thus additional positional representation (Detailed discussion in Sec. 5.1) is needed to model the ordering of tokens.\nContextualized Text:\nIn the vanilla Transformer architecture, deep models are built by employing a residual connection around each module, followed by Layer Normalization.

Transformer architecture, encoder-decoder, encoder-only, decoder-only, sequence-to-sequence, sequence generation\nKey Objects: Transformer architecture, encoder, decoder\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are the core differences between the encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only Transformer architectures?\n- How does the choice of architecture impact the type of problems the Transformer can effectively address?\n- Why would you choose to use only the decoder portion of the Transformer for a specific task?\n---\nSummary:\nThe Transformer architecture can be utilized in three configurations: encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only, each suited for different tasks.\nOriginal Text:\n### 2.2 Model Usage  \nGenerally, the Transformer architecture can be used in three different ways:  \n- · Encoder-Decoder . The full Transformer architecture as introduced in Sec. 2.1 is used. This is typically used in sequence-to-sequence modeling (e.g., neural machine translation).\n- · Encoder only . Only the encoder is used and the outputs of the encoder are utilized as a representation for the input sequence. This is usually used for classification or sequence labeling problems.\n- · Decoder only . Only the decoder is used, where the encoder-decoder cross-attention module is also removed. This is typically used for sequence generation, such as language modeling.\nContextualized Text:\nThe Transformer architecture provides flexibility for various tasks and can be implemented in three primary ways: encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only. The encoder-decoder configuration is complete, suitable for sequence-to-sequence tasks like neural machine translation.  Encoder-only models are used for classification and sequence labeling, while decoder-only models, which omit the cross-attention mechanism, are used for sequence generation tasks, such as language modeling.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "modeling"], "doc_id": "02e43c44-3cfb-4ac3-afdd-fbc4a8d146a0", "summary": "The Transformer architecture can be utilized in three configurations: encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only, each suited for different tasks.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["Transformer architecture", "encoder-decoder", "encoder-only", "decoder-only", "sequence-to-sequence", "sequence generation"], "key_objects": ["Transformer architecture", "encoder", "decoder"], "contextual_text": "The Transformer architecture provides flexibility for various tasks and can be implemented in three primary ways: encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only.

self-attention module and the position-wise FFN) in Table 1. We assume that the hidden dimension D$\\_{m}$ of the model is D , and that the input sequence length is T . The intermediate dimension of FFN is set to 4D and the dimension of keys and values are set to D/H as in Vaswani et al. [137].  \nTable 1.

self-attention, position-wise FFN, complexity, hidden dimension, sequence length\nKey Objects: self-attention, position-wise FFN, hidden dimension, sequence length\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the choice of hidden dimension 'D' affect the overall complexity of the Transformer?\n- Why does the attention distribution matrix become a limiting factor for long sequences?\n- What strategies can be used to improve the long-sequence compatibility of self-attention?\n---\nSummary:\nThe complexity of self-attention is O(T²·D) and the complexity of position-wise FFN is O(T·D²), with the relative importance of hidden dimension 'D' versus sequence length 'T' influencing which component acts as the bottleneck.\nOriginal Text:\n| self-attention    | O ( T 2 · D )       | 4D 2         | -             |\n| position-wise FFN | O ( T 1 · D $^{2}$) | 8D 2         | -             |  \nWhen the input sequences are short, the hidden dimension D dominates the complexity of self-attention and position-wise FFN. The bottleneck of Transformer thus lies in FFN. However, as the input sequences grow longer, the sequence length T gradually dominates the complexity of these modules, in which case self-attention becomes the bottleneck of Transformer. Furthermore, the computation of self-attention requires that a T × T attention distribution matrix is stored, which makes the computation of Transformer infeasible for long-sequence scenarios (e.g., long text documents and pixel-level modeling of high-resolution images). One shall see that the goal of increasing the efficiency of Transformer generally leads to the long-sequence compatibility\nContextualized Text:\nThe complexity of self-attention in a Transformer model is O(T²·D), while the complexity of position-wise FFN is O(T·D²). When dealing with short input sequences, the hidden dimension 'D' is the dominant factor influencing the complexity of both components. As input sequences become longer, the sequence length 'T' gradually dominates, making self-attention the bottleneck. The computation of self-attention necessitates storing a T × T attention distribution matrix, potentially rendering Transformer infeasible for long sequences.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "complexity"], "doc_id": "a0215f88-a7d0-41d9-b764-a72263c40428", "summary": "The complexity of self-attention is O(T²·D) and the complexity of position-wise FFN is O(T·D²), with the relative importance of hidden dimension 'D' versus sequence length 'T' influencing which component acts as the bottleneck.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["self-attention", "position-wise FFN", "complexity", "hidden dimension", "sequence length"], "key_objects": ["self-attention", "position-wise FFN", "hidden dimension", "sequence length"], "contextual_text": "The complexity of self-attention in a Transformer model is O(T²·D), while the complexity of position-wise FFN is O(T·D²).

attention mechanism, multi-head mechanism, prototype, memory compression, low-rank self-attention\nKey Objects: Attention Mechanism, Multi-Head Mechanism, Prototype, Memory\nRefers to Images: ./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_3.png\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How do prototype and memory compression techniques reduce the size of the attention matrix?\n- What is meant by the 'low-rank property' of self-attention, and how is it captured?\n- Why might it be beneficial to supplement standard attention with prior attention distributions?\n---\nSummary:\nSeveral approaches improve upon the standard attention mechanism in Transformers, including methods that reduce the size of the attention matrix and explore alternative multi-head mechanisms.\nOriginal Text:\nFig. 3. Taxonomy of Transformers  \n  \n- (3) Prototype and Memory Compression . This class of methods reduces the number of queries or key-value memory pairs to reduce the size of the attention matrix.\n- (4) Low-rank Self-Attention . This line of work capture the low-rank property of self-attention.\n- (5) Attention with Prior . The line of research explores supplementing or substituting standard attention with prior attention distributions.\n- (6) Improved Multi-Head Mechanism . The line of studies explores different alternative multi-head mechanisms.  \nWe will describe these attention variants at length in the rest of this section.\nContextualized Text:\nTo address the challenges of complexity and lack of structural prior in standard self-attention, several improvement strategies have been developed. These include prototype and memory compression to reduce the size of the attention matrix, low-rank self-attention to capture inherent low-rank properties, attention with prior distributions, and investigations into improved multi-head mechanisms. These variations will be examined in more detail throughout the remainder of this section.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "attention", "transformer"], "doc_id": "aabf053b-c6a3-4b0e-8c8c-c346ac31e0d6", "summary": "Several approaches improve upon the standard attention mechanism in Transformers, including methods that reduce the size of the attention matrix and explore alternative multi-head mechanisms.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["attention mechanism", "multi-head mechanism", "prototype", "memory compression", "low-rank self-attention"], "key_objects": ["Attention Mechanism", "Multi-Head Mechanism", "Prototype", "Memory"], "contextual_text": "To address the challenges of complexity and lack of structural prior in standard self-attention, several improvement strategies have been developed.

Other Network Types  \n2.4.1 Analysis of Self-Attention . As a central piece of Transformer, self-attention comes with a flexible mechanism to deal with variable-length inputs. It can be understood as a fully connected layer where the weights are dynamically generated from pairwise relations from inputs. Table 2 compares the complexity, sequential operations, and maximum path length 4 of self-attention with three commonly used layer types. We summarize the advantages of self-attention as follows:  \n- (1) It has the same maximum path length as fully connected layers, making it suitable for long-range dependencies modeling. Compared to fully connected layers, it is more parameterefficient and more flexible in handling variable-length inputs.\nContextualized Text:\nWithin the Transformer model, self-attention serves as a flexible mechanism for processing variable-length inputs. It can be conceptualized as a fully connected layer where the weights are dynamically generated, based on pairwise relationships between the inputs. This allows for adaptability and efficiency in handling sequences of varying lengths.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "self-attention"], "doc_id": "2d2a6127-47b2-4284-835d-fe49ff42317b", "summary": "Self-attention, a key component of the Transformer architecture, functions as a flexible layer where weights are dynamically generated based on pairwise relationships within the inputs, offering advantages in handling variable-length inputs.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["self-attention", "variable-length inputs", "pairwise relations", "Transformer"], "key_objects": ["Self-Attention", "Inputs"], "contextual_text": "Within the Transformer model, self-attention serves as a flexible mechanism for processing variable-length inputs.

receptive field, long-range dependencies, parallelization, convolutional layers, recurrent layers, self-attention\nKey Objects: receptive field, self-attention, long-range dependencies\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why do convolutional layers typically require stacking many layers to achieve a global receptive field?\n- How does self-attention’s constant path length contribute to its ability to model long-range dependencies?\n- In what ways does self-attention's architecture make it more amenable to parallelization compared to recurrent networks?\n---\nSummary:\nConvolutional layers require deep networks to achieve a global receptive field, whereas self-attention's constant maximum path length allows it to model long-range dependencies with fewer layers. Self-attention also outperforms recurrent layers due to its constant sequential operations and path length, enabling better parallelization and long-range modeling.\nOriginal Text:\n- (2) Due to the limited receptive field of convolutional layers, one typically needs to stack a deep network to have a global receptive field. On the other hand, the constant maximum path length enables self-attention to model long-range dependencies with a constant number of layers.\n- (3) The constant sequential operations and maximum path length make self-attention more parallelizable and better at long-range modeling than recurrent layers.  \nTable 2. Per-layer complexity, minimum number of sequential operations and maximum path lengths for different layer types. T is the sequence length, D is the representation dimension and K is the kernel size of convolutions [137].  \n| Layer Type      | Complexity           | Sequential Operations   |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Per Layer       | (O'T$^{2}$· D)       | (O'1)                   |\n| Self-Attention  | (O'T$^{2}$· D)       | (O'1)                   |\nContextualized Text:\nConvolutional layers have a limited receptive field, meaning they need to be stacked in deep networks to capture global information. In contrast, self-attention's consistent maximum path length allows it to effectively model long-range dependencies using fewer layers. Additionally, self-attention’s consistent sequential operations and maximum path length make it more parallelizable and better suited for long-range dependencies than recurrent layers.	{"tags": ["architecture", "comparison", "NLP", "transformer"], "doc_id": "584f9d5d-3b55-42f5-bfc7-39ac2c43e164", "summary": "Convolutional layers require deep networks to achieve a global receptive field, whereas self-attention's constant maximum path length allows it to model long-range dependencies with fewer layers.

Transformer is often compared against convolutional and recurrent networks. Convolutional networks are known to impose the inductive biases of translation invariance and locality with shared local kernel functions. Similarly, recurrent networks carry the inductive biases of temporal invariance and locality via their Markovian structure [9]. On the other hand, the Transformer architecture makes few assumptions about structural information of data. This makes Transformer a universal and flexible architecture. As a side effect, the lack of structural bias makes Transformer prone to overfitting for small-scale data.\nContextualized Text:\nTable 2 compares the per-layer complexity, minimum sequential operations, and maximum path lengths of different layer types, such as self-attention, fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and recurrent layers.

Graph Neural Networks, GNNs, message passing, Transformer, directed graph\nKey Objects: Transformer, Graph Neural Networks, message passing\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the lack of structural bias in Transformers contrast with the inductive biases found in convolutional or recurrent networks?\n- What is a 'complete directed graph' in the context of the Transformer architecture?\n- If Transformers don't rely on structure, how do they learn relationships between inputs?\n---\nSummary:\nTransformer architectures can be conceptualized as a type of Graph Neural Network (GNN) operating on a complete directed graph, distinguished by their lack of pre-defined structural assumptions about the data.\nOriginal Text:\nAnother closely related network type is Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with message passing [149]. Transformer can be viewed as a GNN defined over a complete directed graph (with self-loop) where each input is a node in the graph. The key difference between Transformer and GNNs is that Transformer introduces no prior knowledge over how input data are structured - the message passing process in Transformer solely depends on similarity measures over the content.  \n$^{4}$The maximum length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse to get from any input position to arbitrary output position. Shorter length implies a better potential for learning long-range dependencies.\nContextualized Text:\nWhen comparing different neural network architectures, the Transformer can be understood as a specialized type of Graph Neural Network (GNN).  Specifically, it’s a GNN that functions over a complete directed graph where each input represents a node. Unlike other networks, the Transformer’s message passing process relies entirely on content similarity, without assuming any prior knowledge about the data’s structure.	{"tags": ["architecture", "deep-learning", "GNN", "NLP"], "doc_id": "aa31128e-af9e-4666-947c-f92296fa4119", "summary": "Transformer architectures can be conceptualized as a type of Graph Neural Network (GNN) operating on a complete directed graph, distinguished by their lack of pre-defined structural assumptions about the data.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Graph Neural Networks", "GNNs", "Transformer"], "keywords": ["Graph Neural Networks", "GNNs", "message passing", "Transformer", "directed graph"], "key_objects": ["Transformer", "Graph Neural Networks", "message passing"], "contextual_text": "When comparing different neural network architectures, the Transformer can be understood as a specialized type of Graph Neural Network (GNN).

title: Sparse Transformer Architecture Tree\nTags: transformer, sparse, architecture, routing, prototype, memory, attention\nKey objects: Sparse, Attention, Routing, Prototype, Memory, Attention, Levels, Architectures\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram depicts a hierarchical tree structure illustrating the evolution and relationships of various sparse transformer architectures. It categorizes these architectures based on different levels of abstraction, starting from the foundational 'sparse' concept and branching out to specific implementations across different levels.\nFull description:\nThe diagram presents a tree-like structure showing different sparse transformer architectures. The root of the tree is labeled 'Sparse', which branches into sub-categories 'Attention', 'Routing', 'Prototype', and 'Memory'. 'Attention' further splits into sub-architectures like 'Starformer,' 'Longformer,' and others, each marked with a reference number. 'Routing' branches out to variations like 'Adaptive Routing.'  'Prototype' includes architectures such as '[...]'. 'Memory' has sub-branches depicting different memory-based transformers. The tree visually organizes the landscape of sparse transformer designs based on their underlying mechanisms and functionality. Each branch represents a line of architectural developments.\nText found in image:\n- Sparse\n- Attention\n- Routing\n- Prototype\n- Memory\n- Attention\n- Levels\n- Architectures\n- Sparse Transformer Architecture Tree\n- Starformer [14]\n- Longformer [13]\n- Routing [10]\n- Prototype [24]\n- Memory [15]\n- Sparse Transformer Architecture Tree\n- Attention\n- Levels\n- Architectures\n- Sparse\n- Routing\n- Prototype\n- Memory\n- Attention\n- Levels\n- Architectures	{"tags": ["transformer", "sparse", "architecture", "routing", "prototype", "memory", "attention"], "title": "Sparse Transformer Architecture Tree", "doc_id": "28fd33f3-d034-4457-8995-9c910410d4b9", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_3.png", "summary": "This diagram depicts a hierarchical tree structure illustrating the evolution and relationships of various sparse transformer architectures.

title: Diagram of a Transformer Architecture\nTags: transformer, neural-network, self-attention, architecture\nKey objects: Multi-Head Attention, Add & Norm, Feed-Forward Network, Positional Encoding, Token Embedding, Inputs\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates a single layer of a Transformer architecture. It shows how the input embeddings, enhanced with positional encoding, are processed through a series of layers, including Multi-Head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks, with Add & Norm operations in between.\nFull description:\nThe diagram depicts a single layer within a Transformer architecture. It starts with 'Inputs' which pass through a 'Token Embedding' layer, followed by the addition of 'Positional Encoding'. The combined output is then processed through a 'Multi-Head Attention' layer, followed by an 'Add & Norm' operation. Subsequently, the result is fed into a 'Feed-Forward Network' before going to another 'Add & Norm'.  This pattern repeats, signified by the 'x' indicating that the layer is repeated multiple times.\nText found in image:\n- Inputs\n- Token Embedding\n- Positional Encoding\n- Multi-Head Attention\n- Add & Norm\n- Feed-Forward Network	{"tags": ["transformer", "neural-network", "self-attention", "architecture"], "title": "Diagram of a Transformer Architecture", "doc_id": "58eeb957-3ec1-47cd-9e00-e6ee4b59afb3", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_2.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates a single layer of a Transformer architecture.

Transformer variants, architecture modifications, pre-training methods, applications, taxonomy\nKey Objects: Transformer, architecture, variants\nRefers to Images: ./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_2.png\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are the three main ways Transformer models have been modified?\n- Why is the attention module considered the key component of the Transformer?\n- Besides architecture modifications, what other areas of Transformer research are covered in this survey?\n---\nSummary:\nThis survey categorizes Transformer variants based on architecture modifications, pre-training methods, and applications, with a focus on architecture modifications.\nOriginal Text:\nFig. 2. Categorization of Transformer variants.  \n  \nFig. 3 illustrates our taxonomy and some representative models.  \nIn this survey, we focus on reviewing the works on architecture modifications. Since the attention module is the key component of Transformer, we solely describe the attention-related variants in Sec. 4 and introduce the other module-level variants in Sec. 5. Then Sec. 6 describes the other architecture-level variants. Finally, we briefly review the works on pre-training in Sec. 7 and applications in Sec. 8. There are some comprehensive surveys on the latter two categories of work, such as pre-trained models (PTMs) [100] and visual Transformers[47, 64].\nContextualized Text:\nThis survey organizes different types of Transformer models into categories based on how they have been modified.

title: Transformer Model Architecture\nTags: transformer, neural-network, NLP, self-attention, architecture, encoder-decoder\nKey objects: Token Embedding, Positional Encoding, Multi-Head Attention, Feed-Forward Network, Add & Norm, Nx\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates a simplified view of a Transformer model architecture. It shows the flow of data through multiple layers, including token embedding, positional encoding, multi-head attention, and feed-forward networks. The architecture highlights various modules and layers involved in processing input sequences.\nFull description:\nThe diagram depicts a stack of identical layers (Nx) processing input data. The process begins with 'Inputs' which are first converted to 'Token Embedding' vectors. These embeddings are then combined with 'Positional Encoding'. The combined information then flows into a 'Multi-Head Attention' layer.  The output from 'Multi-Head Attention' is added and normalized, represented by 'Add & Norm'.  This result is then passed through a 'Feed-Forward Network' before being added and normalized again. The output of the last layer is the final output.\nText found in image:\n- Inputs\n- Token Embedding\n- Positional Encoding\n- Multi-Head Attention\n- Add & Norm\n- Feed-Forward Network\n- Nx	{"tags": ["transformer", "neural-network", "NLP", "self-attention", "architecture", "encoder-decoder"], "title": "Transformer Model Architecture", "doc_id": "38a78818-cd09-44e0-94b0-e94b3b30eaa5", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_2.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates a simplified view of a Transformer model architecture.

self-attention, Transformer, structural bias, complexity, attention mechanism\nKey Objects: self-attention, attention mechanism\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why does self-attention have a complexity of O(1<sup>T</sup>·D)?\n- What does it mean for self-attention to lack 'structural bias'?\n- How do the different approaches to improving attention (e.g., sparse, linearized) try to address the identified challenges?\n---\nSummary:\nSelf-attention is crucial for Transformers, but its complexity and lack of structural bias present challenges, leading to research focused on improving the attention mechanism.\nOriginal Text:\n## 4 ATTENTION  \nSelf-attention plays an important role in Transformer, but there are two challenges in practical applications.  \n- (1) Complexity. As discussion in Sec. 2.3, the complexity of self-attention is O (1 $^{T}$· D ). Therefore, the attention module becomes a bottleneck when dealing with long sequences.\n- (2) Structural prior. Self-attention does no assume any structural bias over inputs. Even the order information is also needed to be learned from training data. Therefore, Transformer (w/o pre-training) is usually easy to overfit on small or moderate-size data.  \nThe improvements on attention mechanism can be divided into several directions:  \n- (1) Sparse Attention. This line of work introduces sparsity bias into the attention mechanism, leading to reduced complexity.\n- (2) Linearized Attention. This line of work disentangles the attention matrix with kernel feature maps. The attention is then computed in reversed order to achieve linear complexity.  \nFig. 3. Taxonomy of Transformers\nContextualized Text:\nIn Transformers, self-attention plays a vital role, but its computational complexity (O(1<sup>T</sup>·D)) can create a bottleneck when processing long sequences. Additionally, self-attention lacks inherent structural bias, requiring training data to learn order information, which can lead to overfitting. To address these challenges, various improvements to the attention mechanism have been explored, including sparse attention, linearized attention, and others.	{"tags": ["NLP", "deep-learning", "architecture", "attention"], "doc_id": "ab3cdc79-1823-4c5f-ac9c-273b9946be37", "summary": "Self-attention is crucial for Transformers, but its complexity and lack of structural bias present challenges, leading to research focused on improving the attention mechanism.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["self-attention", "Transformer", "structural bias", "complexity", "attention mechanism"], "key_objects": ["self-attention", "attention mechanism"], "contextual_text": "In Transformers, self-attention plays a vital role, but its computational complexity (O(1<sup>T</sup>·D)) can create a bottleneck when processing long sequences.

Sparse attention addresses this by limiting the number of query-key pairs a query attends to, reducing complexity by incorporating structural bias.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.1 Sparse Attention  \nIn the standard self-attention mechanism, every token needs to attend to all other tokens. However, it is observed that for the trained Transformers the learned attention matrix A is often very sparse across most data points [17]. Therefore, it is possible to reduce computation complexity by incorporating structural bias to limit the number of query-key pairs that each query attends to. Under this limitation, we just compute the similarity score of the query-key pairs according to pre-defined patterns  \n$$\\hat { A } _ { i j } = \\begin{cases} q _ { i k } T _ { j } & \\text {if token i attends to token j,} \\\\ - \\infty & \\text {if token i does not attend to token j,} \\end{cases}$$  \nwhere ˆ A is un-normalized attention matrix. In implementation the -∞ item is usually not stored in memory so as to decrease memory footprint.\nContextualized Text:\nIn the Transformer model, standard self-attention requires each token to attend to every other token, which can be computationally expensive. To reduce this complexity, sparse attention methods limit the number of query-key pairs a query attends to. This is achieved by incorporating structural bias, which computes similarity scores only for pre-defined patterns.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "optimization"], "doc_id": "ece93dd4-60ac-42ed-b18c-93daff723e30", "summary": "Standard self-attention requires every token to attend to all others, which can be computationally expensive.

sparse attention, query-key pairs, bipartite graph, position-based, content-based\nKey Objects: attention matrix, query, key\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does representing attention as a graph help understand its behavior?\n- What's the trade-off between computational efficiency and expressiveness when using sparse attention?\n- What are the potential benefits of using content-based sparse attention compared to position-based?\n---\nSummary:\nSparse attention reduces computational complexity by limiting the connections between query and key tokens, which can be implemented by either pre-defined patterns or content-based similarity.\nOriginal Text:\nwhere ˆ A is un-normalized attention matrix. In implementation the -∞ item is usually not stored in memory so as to decrease memory footprint.  \nFrom another perspective, the standard attention can be regarded as a complete bipartite graph where each query receives information from all memory nodes and updates its representation. The sparse attention can be considered as a sparse graph where some of the connections between nodes are removed.  \nBased on the metrics of determining the sparse connection, we categorize these approaches into two classes: position-based and content-based sparse attention.  \n- 4.1.1 Position-based Sparse Attention . In position-based sparse attention, the attention matrix is limited according to some pre-defined patterns. Although these sparse patterns vary in different forms, we find that some of them can be decomposed into some atomic sparse patterns.\nContextualized Text:\nIn sparse attention, computation complexity is reduced by limiting the connections between query and key tokens. The un-normalized attention matrix, denoted as ˆ A, is computed with predefined patterns or content-based similarity. Standard attention can be considered a complete bipartite graph where each query attends to all memory nodes, while sparse attention represents a sparse graph where some connections are removed.	{"tags": ["NLP", "attention", "transformers", "sparse"], "doc_id": "3d11a7b8-2d4b-40b4-9abc-a837a754cbcf", "summary": "Sparse attention reduces computational complexity by limiting the connections between query and key tokens, which can be implemented by either pre-defined patterns or content-based similarity.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["sparse attention", "query-key pairs", "bipartite graph", "position-based", "content-based"], "key_objects": ["attention matrix", "query", "key"], "contextual_text": "In sparse attention, computation complexity is reduced by limiting the connections between query and key tokens.

are researchers interested in understanding how different atomic sparse patterns are combined?\n---\nSummary:\nTo categorize and understand sparse attention approaches, researchers identify atomic sparse patterns, describe how these patterns are combined in existing work, and introduce extended patterns for specific data types.\nOriginal Text:\nWe first identify some atomic sparse patterns and then describe how these patterns are composed in some existing work. Finally, we introduce some extended sparse patterns for specific data types.  \n- 4.1.1.1 Atomic Sparse Attention . There are mainly five types of atomic sparse attention patterns, as shown in Fig. 4.\n- (1) Global Attention . To alleviate the degradation of the ability to model the long-range dependencies in sparse attention, one can add some global nodes 5 as the hub for information propagation between nodes. These global nodes can attend all nodes in the sequence and the whole sequence attend to these global nodes, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a).\n- (2) Band Attention ( a.k.a sliding window attention or local attention ). Since most data come with a strong property of locality, it is natural to restrict each query to attend to its neighbor nodes. A widely adopted class of such sparse pattern is band attention, in which the attention matrix is a band matrix as illustrated in Fig. 4(b).\nContextualized Text:\nSparse attention mechanisms are often categorized by identifying fundamental patterns, like global and band attention. These basic patterns are then analyzed to understand how they are used in combination within existing transformer architectures. Researchers also develop extended patterns tailored to specific data types.	{"tags": ["architecture", "sparse attention", "NLP", "transformer"], "doc_id": "08329443-05d2-498f-9838-5e2f1c951c56", "summary": "To categorize and understand sparse attention approaches, researchers identify atomic sparse patterns, describe how these patterns are combined in existing work, and introduce extended patterns for specific data types.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["atomic sparse attention", "sparse patterns", "global attention", "band attention"], "key_objects": ["Atomic Sparse Attention", "Sparse Patterns", "Band Attention", "Global Attention"], "contextual_text": "Sparse attention mechanisms are often categorized by identifying fundamental patterns, like global and band attention.

Analogous to dilated CNNs [134], one can potentially increase the receptive field of the band attention without increasing computation complexity by using a dilated  \n$^{5}$In practice, these global nodes can be selected from the sequence (internal global nodes) or virtual nodes with trainable parameters (external global nodes).  \nFig. 4.

This can be easily extended to strided attention , where the window size is not limited but the dilation w$\\_{d}$ is set to a large value.\nContextualized Text:\nTo broaden the receptive field of band attention without increasing computation, dilated attention can be implemented by introducing gaps in the attention window.

title: Different types of Image Warping\nTags: image-processing, warping, distortion, transformation, pixels\nKey objects: Image, Global Warping, Band Warping, Dilated Warping, Random Warping, Block-Local Warping\n---\nSummary:\nThis figure illustrates five different methods for warping an image, showing how different approaches affect the spatial relationships between pixels. The techniques shown are global warping, band warping, dilated warping, random warping, and block-local warping.\nFull description:\nThe figure presents five image warping techniques. (a) 'global' warping shows a distorted image where the entire image undergoes a uniform transformation. (b) 'band' warping shows horizontal bands of pixels shifted. (c) 'dilated' warping shows diagonal lines through the image, suggesting a pixel-by-pixel alteration. (d) 'random' warping exhibits a scattering pattern, indicating that the image's pixels have been displaced randomly. (e) 'block local' warping shows squares being displaced suggesting a local distortion.\nText found in image:\n- (a) global\n- (b) band\n- (c) dilated\n- (d) random\n- (e) block local	{"tags": ["image-processing", "warping", "distortion", "transformation", "pixels"], "title": "Different types of Image Warping", "doc_id": "7ef6113b-1bb7-4c7e-8f46-8ff989b4bb9d", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_4.png", "summary": "This figure illustrates five different methods for warping an image, showing how different approaches affect the spatial relationships between pixels.

random attention, non-local interactions, random graphs\nKey Objects: random graphs, edges, queries\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why might random graphs have desirable spectral properties for attention mechanisms?\n- How does random attention compare to other sparse attention methods in terms of its ability to capture non-local dependencies?\n- What are the potential drawbacks of using random attention, and how might they be mitigated?\n---\nSummary:\nRandom Attention increases a model's ability to handle non-local interactions by randomly sampling edges for each query, drawing inspiration from the spectral properties of random graphs.\nOriginal Text:\n- (4) Random Attention . To increase the ability of non-local interactions, a few edges are randomly sampled for each query, as illustrated in Fig. 4(d). This is based on the observation that random graphs (e.g., Erdos'Renvi random graph) can have similar spectral properties with complete graphs that leads to a fast mixing time for random walking on graphs.\n- (5) Block Local Attention . This class of attention segments input sequence into several nonoverlapping query blocks, each of which is associated with a local memory block. All the queries in a query block attend to only the keys in the corresponding memory block. Fig. 4(e) depicts a commonly used case where the memory blocks are identical to their corresponding query blocks.\n- 4.1.1.2 Compound Sparse Attention . Existing sparse attentions are often composed of more than one of the above atomic patterns. Fig. 5 illustrates some representative compound sparse attention patterns.\nContextualized Text:\nTo enhance a Transformer model's ability to understand relationships between distant tokens, Random Attention randomly selects a few edges for each query.

Star-Transformer, Longformer, band attention, global attention\nKey Objects: attention patterns, star-shaped graph, global nodes\nRefers to Images: ./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_5.png\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the star-shaped graph in Star-Transformer improve attention?\n- What is the purpose of using global nodes in Longformer?\n- How do these compound attention patterns build upon the atomic sparse attention techniques?\n---\nSummary:\nStar-Transformer combines band attention and a global node, creating a star-shaped graph, while Longformer uses band attention with internal global nodes.\nOriginal Text:\nFig. 5. Some representative compound sparse attention patterns. The red boxes indicate sequence boundaries.  \n  \nStar-Transformer [43] uses a combination of band attention and global attention. Specifically, Star-Transformer just includes only a global node and a band attention with the width of 3, in which any pair of non-adjacent nodes are connected through a shared global node and adjacent nodes are connected directly with each other. This kind of sparse pattern forms a star-shaped graph among nodes. Longformer [10] uses a combination of band attention and internal global-node attention. The global nodes are chosen to be [CLS] token for classification and all question tokens\nContextualized Text:\nCompound sparse attention patterns often combine multiple atomic patterns. For example, Star-Transformer uses a combination of band attention and a single global node to form a star-shaped graph where non-adjacent nodes are connected through a global node. Longformer, on the other hand, combines band attention with internal global nodes to enhance performance.	{"tags": ["attention", "transformers", "architecture"], "doc_id": "4bdb059e-f562-46e3-a99d-8fa0d4f6ecc9", "summary": "Star-Transformer combines band attention and a global node, creating a star-shaped graph, while Longformer uses band attention with internal global nodes.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Star-Transformer", "Longformer"], "keywords": ["Star-Transformer", "Longformer", "band attention", "global attention"], "key_objects": ["attention patterns", "star-shaped graph", "global nodes"], "contextual_text": "Compound sparse attention patterns often combine multiple atomic patterns.

title: Star-Transformer Architecture\nTags: transformer, neural-network, architecture, connectivity, star-network\nKey objects: Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, Layer 4, Layer 5, Layer 6, Layer 7, Layer 8, Connections\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates the architecture of a Star-Transformer model. It depicts a unique connectivity pattern where each layer connects directly to every other layer, forming a star-like structure. The diagram highlights the layers as rectangular blocks, showcasing this full connectivity and the associated data flow.\nFull description:\nThe diagram showcases a Star-Transformer model's architecture. Each rectangular block represents a 'Layer,' labeled from 1 to 8. The key characteristic is the connections between these layers. Each layer is directly connected to every other layer. For example, 'Layer 1' is connected to 'Layer 2', 'Layer 3', 'Layer 4', 'Layer 5', 'Layer 6', 'Layer 7', and 'Layer 8'. This pattern repeats for all other layers, forming a star-like connectivity where each layer acts as a central node with links to every other layer. The diagram emphasizes this unique interconnection method, showing how information flows directly between any two layers in the network.\nText found in image:\n- Star-Transformer\n- Layer 1\n- Layer 2\n- Layer 3\n- Layer 4\n- Layer 5\n- Layer 6\n- Layer 7\n- Layer 8	{"tags": ["transformer", "neural-network", "architecture", "connectivity", "star-network"], "title": "Star-Transformer Architecture", "doc_id": "a6b71423-e314-4dbd-898e-e7aca11da3fb", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_5.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates the architecture of a Star-Transformer model.

band attention, global attention, dilated window attention, sparse attention, Longformer, Extended Transformer Construction, BigBird\nKey Objects: band attention, global attention, sparse attention models, attention heads\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why would incorporating a masking mechanism benefit structured inputs?\n- What is the significance of being able to simulate a Turing Machine with sparse attention?\n- How does dilated window attention contribute to expanding the receptive field?\n---\nSummary:\nLongformer and Extended Transformer Construction (ETC) combine band attention with global nodes, while also incorporating dilated window attention and external global-node attention for increased receptive field and pre-training capabilities.\nOriginal Text:\nfor Question Answering tasks. They also replace some of the band attention heads in upper layers with dilated window attention to increase the receptive field without increasing computation. As a concurrent work to Longformer [10], Extended Transformer Construction (ETC) [1] utilizes combination of band attention and external global-node attention. ETC also includes a masking mechanism to handle structured inputs and adapt Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) [135] for pre-training. In addition to the band and global attention, BigBird [163] uses additional random attention to approximate full attention. Their theoretical analysis also reveals that the usage of a sparse encoder and sparse decoder can simulate any Turing Machine, which explains the success of those sparse attention models.\nContextualized Text:\nTo enhance performance, Longformer and Extended Transformer Construction (ETC) combine band attention with global nodes. ETC utilizes external global nodes, incorporates a masking mechanism for structured inputs, and adapts Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) for pre-training. Furthermore, dilated window attention is used to expand the receptive field. BigBird utilizes random attention to approximate full attention, and its theoretical analysis suggests that sparse attention models can simulate Turing Machines.	{"tags": ["transformers", "attention mechanisms", "sparse attention", "architecture"], "doc_id": "b483f80a-ecfc-4102-9425-3e712981232e", "summary": "Longformer and Extended Transformer Construction (ETC) combine band attention with global nodes, while also incorporating dilated window attention and external global-node attention for increased receptive field and pre-training capabilities.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Longformer", "Extended Transformer Construction", "BigBird", "CPC", "CLS"], "keywords": ["band attention", "global attention", "dilated window attention", "sparse attention", "Longformer", "Extended Transformer Construction", "BigBird"], "key_objects": ["band attention", "global attention", "sparse attention models", "attention heads"], "contextual_text": "To enhance performance, Longformer and Extended Transformer Construction (ETC) combine band attention with global nodes.

sparse attention, factorized attention, sparse transformer, band attention, strided attention, block local attention, global attention\nKey Objects: Sparse Transformer, sparse patterns, data, band attention, strided attention, block local attention, global attention\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the choice of sparse patterns influence the performance of Sparse Transformer on different data types?\n- What are the advantages of using factorized attention compared to a standard attention mechanism?\n- Why is it beneficial to use a combination of different sparse attention patterns?\n---\nSummary:\nSparse Transformer employs a factorized attention mechanism, combining different sparse patterns based on the data's characteristics, such as using band and strided attention for periodic data like images and block local attention with global nodes for non-periodic data like text.\nOriginal Text:\nSparse Transformer [17] uses a factorized attention where different sparse patterns are designed for different types of data. For data with a periodic structure (e.g., images), it uses a composition of band attention and strided attention. Whereas for data without a periodic structure (e.g., text), it uses a composition of block local attention combined with global attention, where global nodes are from fixed positions in the input sequence.  \n4.1.1.3 Extended Sparse Attention. Apart from the above patterns, some existing studies have explored extended sparse patterns for specific data types.\nContextualized Text:\nTo adapt to various data types, Sparse Transformer utilizes a factorized attention approach.

extended sparse attention, binary tree, BP-Transformer, global attention\nKey Objects: binary tree, tokens, global attention\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does BP-Transformer’s binary tree approach improve upon traditional global attention?\n- What are the advantages of using a hierarchical structure for connecting tokens in a sparse attention mechanism?\n- Can the binary tree approach used by BP-Transformer be applied to other data types besides text?\n---\nSummary:\nExtended sparse attention methods explore novel patterns for specific data types, such as BP-Transformer which constructs a binary tree to connect tokens through hierarchical nodes and paths.\nOriginal Text:\n4.1.1.3 Extended Sparse Attention. Apart from the above patterns, some existing studies have explored extended sparse patterns for specific data types.  \nFor text data, BP-Transformer [158] constructs a binary tree where all tokens are leaf nodes and the internal nodes are span nodes containing many tokens. The edges in this graph are constructed so that each leaf node is connected to its neighbor leaf nodes and higher-level span nodes containing tokens from a longer distance. This approach can be seen as an extension of global attention, where global nodes are hierarchically organized and any pair of tokens are connected with paths in the binary tree. An abstract view of this method is illustrated in Fig. 6(a).\nContextualized Text:\nBeyond the established sparse attention patterns, researchers have explored extended methods tailored for specific data types. For example, BP-Transformer utilizes a binary tree structure where tokens are organized as leaf nodes and connected through hierarchical span nodes. This approach extends global attention by organizing global nodes hierarchically and enabling connections between tokens via paths within the tree.	{"tags": ["sparse attention", "NLP", "transformer", "architecture"], "doc_id": "489dc08c-d5e5-4ef0-9126-9fe022faae02", "summary": "Extended sparse attention methods explore novel patterns for specific data types, such as BP-Transformer which constructs a binary tree to connect tokens through hierarchical nodes and paths.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["BP-Transformer"], "keywords": ["extended sparse attention", "binary tree", "BP-Transformer", "global attention"], "key_objects": ["binary tree", "tokens", "global attention"], "contextual_text": "Beyond the established sparse attention patterns, researchers have explored extended methods tailored for specific data types.

vision data, image transformer, axial transformer, sparse attention\nKey Objects: image pixels, attention modules\nRefers to Images: ./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_6.png\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does Axial Transformer's approach of applying attention over each axis improve performance?\n- What are the trade-offs between 2D block local attention and applying attention modules over each axis?\n- Can the techniques used in Image Transformer and Axial Transformer be adapted for other data types?\n---\nSummary:\nFor vision data, approaches like Image Transformer and Axial Transformer utilize block local sparse attention and independent attention modules over image axes to reduce computational complexity.\nOriginal Text:\nThere are also some extensions for vision data. Image Transformer [94] explores two types of attention: (1) flattening image pixels in raster-scan order and then applying block local sparse attention. (2) 2D block local attention, where query blocks and memory blocks are arranged directly in 2D plate, as depicted in Fig. 6(b). As another example of sparse pattern on vision data, Axial Transformer [54] applies independent attention modules over each axis of the image. Each attention module mixes information along one axis while keeping information along the other axis independent, as illustrated in Fig. 6(c). This can be understood as horizontally and vertically flattening image pixels in raster-scan order and then applying strided attention with gaps of image width and height, respectively.  \n\nContextualized Text:\nExtensions for vision data have been developed, such as Image Transformer applying block local sparse attention and Axial Transformer applying independent attention modules over image axes.

title: Binary Decision Tree for Iris Dataset\nTags: decision-tree, machine-learning, classification, iris-dataset, algorithm, data-mining\nKey objects: Root Node, Internal Nodes, Leaf Nodes, Decision Boundaries, Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, Iris Virginica\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates a binary decision tree used to classify Iris flowers based on their features. The tree's nodes represent decisions based on feature values, leading to classifications of different Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).\nFull description:\nThe diagram represents a decision tree for classifying Iris flowers. The top-most node, the 'Root Node', splits the data based on a decision boundary, represented by the value '0.3'. This split leads to two branches.  Each branch further splits based on additional decision boundaries, represented by values '0.8' and others, to progressively refine the classification. The leaf nodes at the end of the branches represent the final classifications: 'Iris Setosa', 'Iris Versicolor', and 'Iris Virginica'.\nText found in image:\n- 0.3\n- 0.8\n- Iris Setosa\n- Iris Versicolor\n- Iris Virginica	{"tags": ["decision-tree", "machine-learning", "classification", "iris-dataset", "algorithm", "data-mining"], "title": "Binary Decision Tree for Iris Dataset", "doc_id": "98280a37-3a17-4d91-9678-6dedc480afbb", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_6.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates a binary decision tree used to classify Iris flowers based on their features.

methods create sparse graphs where connections are determined by the input content, rather than pre-defined patterns.\nOriginal Text:\n  \nFig. 6. Other types of sparse attentions. The red box indicates the query position, and the orange nodes/squares means corresponding tokens are attended to by the query.  \n  \n4.1.2 Content-based Sparse Attention . Another line of work creates a sparse graph based on input content, i.e., the sparse connections are conditioned on inputs.\nContextualized Text:\nA different approach, content-based sparse attention, creates sparse graphs by conditioning the connections on the input content.

title: Binary Search Tree (BST) Visualization\nTags: tree, binary-search-tree, data-structure, algorithm, graph\nKey objects: Root Node, Child Nodes, Parent Node, Directed Edge, Binary Search Tree\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates a Binary Search Tree (BST) structure. It shows a root node connected to several child nodes, which are further linked to their own children, creating a hierarchical tree-like structure. Nodes are linked using directed edges, demonstrating the parent-child relationships within the tree.\nFull description:\nThe diagram depicts a Binary Search Tree (BST) with a single root node connecting to several child nodes. Each child node also has connections to other nodes below, creating branches. The edges between nodes represent the hierarchical relationships in the tree structure. A single label '4.1 BST' is presented at the bottom of the image.\nText found in image:\n- 4.1 BST	{"tags": ["tree", "binary-search-tree", "data-structure", "algorithm", "graph"], "title": "Binary Search Tree (BST) Visualization", "doc_id": "aa4ab28c-e6ef-4879-999f-11759a0eb7d7", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_6.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates a Binary Search Tree (BST) structure.

random feature maps, approximation, attention scores, stability, Performer\nKey Objects: random feature maps, attention scores\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why are non-negative attention scores desirable in linearized attention?\n- How does Performer's positive random feature map address the limitations of the trigonometric approach?\n- What are some potential consequences of using random feature maps that do not guarantee non-negative attention scores?\n---\nSummary:\nTo address instability issues arising from the use of trigonometric random feature maps, Performer's second version introduces positive random feature maps that guarantee non-negative attention scores, resulting in improved stability and approximation results.\nOriginal Text:\nAlthough the trigonometric random feature map leads to an unbiased approximation, it does not guarantee non-negative attention scores and thus could lead to unstable behaviors and abnormal behaviors. To mitigate this issue, the second version of Performer [19] proposes positive random feature maps, which uses h ( x ) = exp ( - ∥ ∥ 2 $\\_{L}$, l $\\_{2}$) , 1 = 1, f$\\_{i}$ = exp and thus guarantees unbiased and nonnegative approximation of dot-product attention. This approach is more stable than Choromanski et al. [18] and reports better approximation results.  \nIn addition to using random feature maps to approximate standard dot product attention, Peng et al. [95] and Choromanski et al. [19] also explore approximating order-1 arc-cosine kernel with h ( x ) = 1, 1 = 1, f$\\_{i}$ = ReLU. This feature map has been shown to be effective in various tasks including machine translation and protein sequence modeling.\nContextualized Text:\nLinearized attention methods sometimes utilize trigonometric random feature maps to approximate the unnormalized attention matrix. However, these maps do not always guarantee non-negative attention scores, potentially leading to unstable behaviors. To overcome this, Performer’s second version uses positive random feature maps, which ensure non-negative attention scores, leading to greater stability and improved results.	{"tags": ["linearized attention", "approximation", "transformers", "deep-learning"], "doc_id": "00d0a22f-0bbf-45a9-8a87-b3bda1a19824", "summary": "To address instability issues arising from the use of trigonometric random feature maps, Performer's second version introduces positive random feature maps that guarantee non-negative attention scores, resulting in improved stability and approximation results.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Performer"], "keywords": ["random feature maps", "approximation", "attention scores", "stability", "Performer"], "key_objects": ["random feature maps", "attention scores"], "contextual_text": "Linearized attention methods sometimes utilize trigonometric random feature maps to approximate the unnormalized attention matrix.

title: Diagrams of Grid Paths\nTags: grid, path, line, turn, direction\nKey objects: Grid, Path, Sharp Turn, Straight Line, Vertical Line\n---\nSummary:\nThe image displays two diagrams illustrating paths within a grid. The first diagram shows a path with a sharp 90-degree turn, while the second diagram showcases a straight-line path extending vertically through the grid.\nFull description:\nThe image consists of two separate diagrams set against a grid background. The first diagram, labeled '(1) Sharp Turn', depicts a path that abruptly changes direction at a 90-degree angle. The second diagram, labeled '(2) Straight Line', illustrates a path that proceeds directly upwards in a vertical orientation through the grid.\nText found in image:\n- (1) Sharp Turn\n- (2) Straight Line	{"tags": ["grid", "path", "line", "turn", "direction"], "title": "Diagrams of Grid Paths", "doc_id": "b6176c75-b420-46c4-b5fe-6871a65d6b9f", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_7.png", "summary": "The image displays two diagrams illustrating paths within a grid.

content-based sparse attention, maximum inner product search, k-means clustering, routing transformer, sparse graph\nKey Objects: queries, keys, cluster centroid vectors, sparse graph\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does Maximum Inner Product Search improve the efficiency of content-based sparse attention?\n- What are the advantages of using k-means clustering for content-based attention?\n- How does the grouping of queries and keys by k-means clustering affect the model's ability to capture complex relationships in the data?\n---\nSummary:\nTo create content-based sparse attention, a common approach is to select keys that are likely to have high similarity scores with a given query, often utilizing techniques like Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). The Routing Transformer employs k-means clustering to group queries and keys, ensuring each query attends only to keys within the same cluster.\nOriginal Text:\nA straightforward way of constructing a content-based sparse graph is to select those keys that are likely to have large similarity scores with the given query. To efficiently construct the sparse graph, we can recur to Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem, where one tries to find the keys with maximum dot product with a query without computing all dot product terms. Routing Transformer [11] uses k-means clustering to cluster both queries { q$\\_{i}$ } T i - 1 and keys { k$\\_{i}$ } T i - 1 are same set of centroid vectors { µ$\\_{i}$ } T i - 1 k$\\_{i}$ . Each query only attends to the keys that belong to the same cluster. During training, the cluster centroid vectors are updated using the exponentially moving average of vectors assigned to it, divided by the exponentially moving average of cluster counts: µ$\\_{i}$ ← λ µ$\\_{i}$ + (1 - λ ) ( ∑ q$\\_{i}$ q$\\_{i}$ + ∑ j = µ$\\_{j}$ ( k$\\_{j}$ ) , (8) c$\\_{µ}$ ← λ c$\\_{µ}$ + (1 - λ ) µ$\\_{i}$ , (9) µ ← λ µ$\\_{i}$ , (10)\nContextualized Text:\nA method for content-based sparse attention involves selecting keys that likely have high similarity scores with a query, often leveraging Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). As an example, the Routing Transformer uses k-means clustering to group queries and keys, which limits attention to keys within the same cluster.	{"tags": ["attention", "sparse attention", "NLP", "transformers", "content-based"], "doc_id": "891d332a-cfeb-465d-9bd5-1231083af41f", "summary": "To create content-based sparse attention, a common approach is to select keys that are likely to have high similarity scores with a given query, often utilizing techniques like Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS).

How does k-means clustering improve the efficiency of attention mechanisms?\n- What is the purpose of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in the context of attention?\n- What are the potential limitations of relying on clustering or hashing for content-based attention?\n---\nSummary:\nRouting Transformer utilizes k-means clustering to assign queries to keys, allowing each query to attend only to keys within the same cluster. Reformer further employs locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to group similar queries and keys, enabling efficient attention by focusing on tokens within the same hashing bucket.\nOriginal Text:\nwhere | µ | denotes the number of vectors currently in cluster µ and λ ∈ (0 , 1) is a hyperparameter. Let P$\\_{i}$ denote the set of indices of keys that the i-th query attend to. P$\\_{i}$ in Routing Transformer is defined as  \n$$P _ { i } = \\{ j \\, \\colon \\mu ( q _ { i } ) = \\mu ( k ) \\}.$$  \nReformer [66] uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to select key-value pairs for each query. The proposed LSH attention allows each token to attend only to the tokens within the same hashing bucket. The basic idea is to use an LSH function to hash queries and keys into several buckets, with similar items fall in the same bucket with high probability. Specifically, they use the random matrix method for the LSH function. Let b be the number of buckets, given a random matrix R of size [ D$\\_{k}$, b/2] , the LSH function is computed by :  \n$$h ( x ) = \\arg \\max \\left [ x R ; - x R \\right ].$$  \nThe LSH attention allows the i-th query to attend only to key-value pairs with indices\nContextualized Text:\nTo efficiently construct a content-based sparse graph, Routing Transformer and Reformer leverage different techniques. Routing Transformer uses k-means clustering to group queries and keys, ensuring that each query attends only to keys within the same cluster. Reformer enhances this process with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), which assigns similar queries and keys to the same hashing bucket, enabling focused attention.	{"tags": ["attention", "transformers", "NLP", "algorithms"], "doc_id": "4f6d48cc-69da-48ca-847d-e6654b6e3f4d", "summary": "Routing Transformer utilizes k-means clustering to assign queries to keys, allowing each query to attend only to keys within the same cluster.

locality-sensitive hashing, LSH, attention, sparse connection\nKey Objects: Queries, Keys, Hashing Buckets, LSH Attention\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does LSH ensure that similar queries and keys are grouped together?\n- What are the advantages of using LSH over other sparse attention methods?\n- How does SAC's reinforcement learning approach contribute to adaptive attention?\n---\nSummary:\nReformer uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to efficiently select key-value pairs for attention by hashing queries and keys into buckets, allowing each query to attend only to pairs within the same bucket.\nOriginal Text:\n$$h ( x ) = \\arg \\max \\left [ x R ; - x R \\right ].$$  \nThe LSH attention allows the i-th query to attend only to key-value pairs with indices  \n$$P _ { i } = \\{ j \\, \\colon h ( q _ { i } ) = h ( k ) \\}.$$  \nSparse Adaptive Connection (SAC) [78] views the input sequence as a graph and learns to construct attention edges to improve task-specific performances using an adaptive sparse connection. SAC uses an LSTM edge predictor to construct edges between tokens. With no ground truth for edges, the edge predictor is trained with reinforcement learning.\nContextualized Text:\nTo improve attention efficiency, Reformer utilizes locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). This method involves using a random matrix R to hash both queries and keys into several buckets.  Consequently, each query only attends to key-value pairs that fall within the same hashing bucket, as determined by the function $$h ( x ) = \text{argmax} [ x R ; - x R \right ].”  Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC) builds on this by learning to construct attention edges using an LSTM edge predictor, trained through reinforcement learning.	{"tags": ["NLP", "deep-learning", "attention", "transformers", "sparse attention"], "doc_id": "8113da72-f05a-418b-a917-e76e72ec7cb8", "summary": "Reformer uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to efficiently select key-value pairs for attention by hashing queries and keys into buckets, allowing each query to attend only to pairs within the same bucket.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Reformer", "LSTM", "SAC"], "keywords": ["locality-sensitive hashing", "LSH", "attention", "sparse connection"], "key_objects": ["Queries", "Keys", "Hashing Buckets", "LSH Attention"], "contextual_text": "To improve attention efficiency, Reformer utilizes locality-sensitive hashing (LSH).

sparse attention, Sinkhorn normalization, block sparse attention, locality\nKey Objects: Queries, Keys, Key Blocks, Query Blocks, Sorting Network\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does Sinkhorn normalization contribute to the sparse attention mechanism?\n- Why is it beneficial to limit attention to key blocks instead of individual keys?\n- In what ways does this approach complement or differ from other sparse attention techniques like block local attention?\n---\nSummary:\nSparse Sinkhorn Attention assigns key blocks to query blocks using a sorting network and Sinkhorn normalization, limiting each query's attention to keys within its assigned block to enhance the model's ability to capture locality.\nOriginal Text:\nSparse Sinkhorn Attention [132] first splits queries and keys into several blocks and assigns a key block to each query block. Each query is only allowed to attend to the keys in the key block that is assigned to its corresponding query block. The assignment of key blocks is controlled by a sorting network, which uses Sinkhorn normalization to produce a doubly stochastic matrix as the permutation matrix representing the assignment. They use this content-based block sparse attention along with block local attention introduced in Sec. 4.1.1 to enhance the ability of the model to model locality.\nContextualized Text:\nTo further reduce computational complexity, Sparse Sinkhorn Attention divides queries and keys into blocks. Each query's attention is then limited to the keys within a specifically assigned key block. This assignment is managed by a sorting network leveraging Sinkhorn normalization to create a permutation matrix, which ultimately enhances the model's capability to model locality.	{"tags": ["attention", "sparse", "transformers", "locality"], "doc_id": "dcaecbed-f382-4a74-9f9e-fed3f2ae75e9", "summary": "Sparse Sinkhorn Attention assigns key blocks to query blocks using a sorting network and Sinkhorn normalization, limiting each query's attention to keys within its assigned block to enhance the model's ability to capture locality.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Sparse Sinkhorn Attention"], "keywords": ["sparse attention", "Sinkhorn normalization", "block sparse attention", "locality"], "key_objects": ["Queries", "Keys", "Key Blocks", "Query Blocks", "Sorting Network"], "contextual_text": "To further reduce computational complexity, Sparse Sinkhorn Attention divides queries and keys into blocks.

linearized attention, attention mechanism, complexity, softmax, unnormalized attention matrix\nKey Objects: Attention Mechanism, Complexity, Unnormalized Attention Matrix\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is the computational complexity of standard attention quadratic?\n- How does disentangling softmax(QKᵀ) into QKᵀ enable a reduction in complexity?\n- What is the purpose of the unnormalized attention matrix?\n---\nSummary:\nLinearized attention methods aim to reduce the computational complexity of standard attention mechanisms by approximating or replacing the unnormalized attention matrix, allowing for a linear complexity with respect to sequence length.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.2 Linearized Attention  \nAssuming Q , K , V ∈$\\_{R}$ T × $^{D}$, the complexity of computing softmax( QK $^{T}$)V is quadratic w.r.t. sequence length T , as illustrated in Fig. 7(a). If softmax( QK $^{T}$) can be disentangled into QK $^{T}$, we can compute QK $^{T}$V in reversed order (i.e., Q $^{'}$( K $^{T}$V )), leading to a complexity of O( T ) .  \nLet ˆ A = exp( QK $^{T}$) denote un-normalized attention matrix, and exp( · ) is applied element-wise, the regular attention can be rewritten as Z = D $^{-1}$ˆ A V , where D = diag( ˆ A 1 $\\_{T}$) 1 T is the all-ones column vector of length T ; diag( · ) is a diagonal matrix with the input vector as the diagonal.\nContextualized Text:\nTo address the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms, linearized attention methods approximate or replace the unnormalized attention matrix (exp( QKᵀ )) with a more manageable form.

unnormalized attention matrix using feature maps, allowing for a linearized computation of the matrix by computing ˆ Q( Q )( ˆ θ( K $^{T}$)V.\nOriginal Text:\nLinearized attention is a class of methods that approximate or replace the unnormalized attention matrix exp( QK $^{T}$) with ˆ Q( Q ) ˆ θ( K $^{T}$, where ˆ θ is a feature map that is applied in row-wise manner. Hence the computation of unnormalized attention matrix can be linearized by computing ˆ Q( Q )( ˆ θ( K $^{T}$)V $^{6}$, as illustrated in Fig. 7(b).  \nFig. 7. Illustration of complexity difference between standard self-attention and linearized self-attention.  \n  \nTo gain further insights into linearized attention, we derive the formulation in vector form. We consider a general form of attention  \n$$z _ { i } = \\sum _ { j } \\frac { \\sin ( q _ { i }, k _ { j } ) } { \\sum _ { j } \\sin ( q _ { i }, k _ { j } ) } v _ { j },$$\nContextualized Text:\nAs a way to reduce computational complexity in Transformer models, linearized attention is used.

title: Standard and Linearized Self-Attention\nTags: self-attention, neural-network, NLP, linear-transformation, softmax, architecture\nKey objects: Query (Q), Key (K), Value (V), Linear Transformation, Softmax, Output (Z)\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates two variations of self-attention mechanisms: standard self-attention and linearized self-attention. Both architectures process query (Q), key (K), and value (V) inputs, but they differ in how they combine these inputs to produce the final output Z.\nFull description:\nThe diagram shows two self-attention mechanisms. In (a), the 'Query' (Q), 'Key' (K), and 'Value' (V) are each passed through a linear transformation. The results of the key and query linear transformations are then combined with the softmax function. The result of this operation is multiplied by the value's linear transformation, producing the output Z.  In (b), the 'Query' (Q) is first linearly transformed, then multiplied by the key's linear transformation, which is further multiplied by the value’s linear transformation, resulting in the output Z.\nText found in image:\n- Q\n- K\n- V\n- Linear\n- Softmax\n- Z\n- (a) standard self-attention\n- (b) linearized self-attention	{"tags": ["self-attention", "neural-network", "NLP", "linear-transformation", "softmax", "architecture"], "title": "Standard and Linearized Self-Attention", "doc_id": "fc9da745-8dcb-4756-8d1c-99114d13d9d0", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_8.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates two variations of self-attention mechanisms: standard self-attention and linearized self-attention.

attention mechanism, scoring function, kernel function, similarity, vectors\nKey Objects: attention, vectors, scoring function, kernel function, query, key, value\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is the purpose of using a scoring function in the attention mechanism?\n- How does the kernel function transform the input vectors?\n- What are the benefits of using a generalized attention formulation?\n---\nSummary:\nThis text chunk presents a generalized formulation of attention, demonstrating how it can be expressed using a scoring function and a kernel function to measure similarity between input vectors.\nOriginal Text:\n$$z _ { i } = \\sum _ { j } \\frac { \\sin ( q _ { i }, k _ { j } ) } { \\sum _ { j } \\sin ( q _ { i }, k _ { j } ) } v _ { j },$$  \nwhere sim( · , · ) is a scoring function measuring similarity between input vectors. In vanilla Transformer, the scoring function is the exponential of inner product exp( · , · ) . A natural choice of sim( · , · ) is a kernel function K( x, y ) = φ ( x ) φ ( y ) $^{T}$, which leads to  \n$$z _ { i } = \\sum _ { j } \\frac { \\phi ( q _ { i } ) \\phi ( k _ { j } ) ^ { T } } { \\sum _ { j } \\rho _ { i } ( q _ { i } ) \\phi ( k _ { j } ) ^ { T } } v _ { j } \\\\ = \\frac { \\phi ( q _ { i } ) \\sum _ { j } \\phi ( k _ { j } ) ^ { T } } { \\phi ( q _ { i } ) \\sum _ { j } \\phi ( k _ { j } ) ^ { T } }.$$\nContextualized Text:\nTo provide a generalized attention mechanism, the text presents a formula where z_i represents a weighted sum of values v_j, with weights determined by the similarity between query q_i and key k_j, as measured by a scoring function. The scoring function can be a kernel function K(x, y) = φ(x)φ(y)^T, which transforms the query and key into feature vectors φ before measuring similarity. This approach allows for a flexible way to compute attention and highlights its underlying mathematical structure.	{"tags": ["NLP", "deep-learning", "attention", "transformer", "kernel"], "doc_id": "09545795-62c3-4119-9cc5-315362a4b942", "summary": "This text chunk presents a generalized formulation of attention, demonstrating how it can be expressed using a scoring function and a kernel function to measure similarity between input vectors.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer", "ReLU"], "keywords": ["attention mechanism", "scoring function", "kernel function", "similarity", "vectors"], "key_objects": ["attention", "vectors", "scoring function", "kernel function", "query", "key", "value"], "contextual_text": "To provide a generalized attention mechanism, the text presents a formula where z_i represents a weighted sum of values v_j, with weights determined by the similarity between query q_i and key k_j, as measured by a scoring function.

linearized attention, feature map, cumulative sums, RNN, autoregressive attention\nKey Objects: feature map, cumulative sums, memory matrix\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does pre-computing cumulative sums improve the efficiency of the Transformer decoder?\n- In what way does linearized attention allow Transformer decoders to function like RNNs?\n- What are the components of the memory matrix, and how does it enable the model to 'retrieve a value'?\n---\nSummary:\nLinearized attention can be achieved by computing cumulative sums of feature-mapped keys and values, enabling Transformer decoders to function similarly to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by pre-computing certain terms.\nOriginal Text:\nwhere ˆ Q denotes outer product of vectors. Based on this formulation, attention can be linearized by first computing the highlighted terms Σ$\\_{j}$ φ ( k$\\_{j}$ ) ∂ v$\\_{j}$ and Σ$\\_{j}$ Φ ( k$\\_{j}$ ) $^{T}$. This could be especially beneficial for autoregressive attention, as the cumulative sums S$\\_{i}$ = Σ$\\_{j}$$\\_{-}$$\\_{1}$ ˆ θ( k$\\_{j}$ ) ∂ v$\\_{j}$ and u$\\_{i}$ = Σ$\\_{j}$$\\_{-}$$\\_{1}$ ˆ θ( k$\\_{j}$ ) can be computed from S$\\_{i}$$\\_{-}$$\\_{1}$ and u$\\_{i}$$\\_{-}$$\\_{1}$ in constant time. The effectively enables Transformer decoders to run like RNNs.  \nAn interpretation of Eq. (16) is that the model maintains a memory matrix by aggregating associations represented by outer products of (feature mapped) keys and values, and then retrieve a value by multiplying the memory matrix with feature mapped query with proper normalization. There are two key components in this approach: (1) feature map φ ( · ) , and (2) aggregation rule.\nContextualized Text:\nTo enable Transformer decoders to run like RNNs, linearized attention allows for the pre-computation of cumulative sums of feature-mapped keys and values.

feature map, elu, linear transformer, transformer\nKey Objects: feature map, elu\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is the purpose of a feature map in the context of linearized attention?\n- Why might a feature map like elu(xᵢ)+1 perform similarly to standard dot product attention?\n- How does the choice of feature map impact the overall performance of the Linear Transformer?\n---\nSummary:\nLinear Transformer employs a feature map φ(x) = elu(xᵢ)+1 which, despite not aiming to directly approximate dot product attention, has demonstrated performance comparable to standard Transformer models.\nOriginal Text:\n4.2.1 Feature Maps. Linear Transformer [62] propose to use a simple feature map φ ( x ) = e lu ( x$\\_{i}$ )+1. This feature map does not aim to approximate dot product attention, but is empirically proved to perform on par with the standard Transformer.  \n$^{6}$Similarly, the partition term D can be computed with φ ( Q ) ( ˆ θ( K ) $^{T}$1 T ) in linear time.  \nPerformer [18, 19] uses random feature maps that approximate the scoring function of transformer. The random feature maps take functions f$\\_{1}$ , · · · , f$\\_{i}$ : R → R and h : R D → R .  \n$$\\phi ( x ) = \\frac { h ( x ) \\left [ f _ { 1 } ( \\omega _ { 1 } ^ { T } x ), \\cdots, f _ { m } ( \\omega _ { m } ^ { T } x ), \\cdots, f _ { i } ( \\omega _ { 1 } ^ { T } x ), \\cdots, f _ { i } ( \\omega _ { m } ^ { T } x ) \\right ], \\quad ( 1 7 )$$  \nwhere ω$\\_{1}$, · · · , ω$\\_{m}$ ∈ D are drawn from some distribution D ∈ P ( R $^{D}$) .\nContextualized Text:\nTo facilitate linearized attention, the Linear Transformer utilizes a simple feature map, φ(x) = elu(xᵢ)+1.

random fourier feature map, trigonometric functions, random feature attention, approximation, Performer, RFA\nKey Objects: random fourier feature map, trigonometric functions, feature map\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why did Performer draw inspiration from random Fourier feature maps?\n- What is the difference between the feature map used in the first version of Performer and its use in Random Feature Attention (RFA)?\n- How does normalizing the queries and keys before applying the feature map impact the approximation process?\n---\nSummary:\nPerformer utilizes random Fourier feature maps, originally used to approximate Gaussian kernels, by employing trigonometric functions to approximate attention. Random Feature Attention (RFA) builds upon this by normalizing queries and keys before applying the feature map.\nOriginal Text:\nwhere ω$\\_{1}$, · · · , ω$\\_{m}$ ∈ D are drawn from some distribution D ∈ P ( R $^{D}$) .  \nThe first version of Performer [18] is inspired from the random Fourier feature map [105] that was originally used to approximate Gaussian kernel. It uses trigonometric functions with h ( x ) = exp ( ∥ ∥ 2 $\\_{L}$, l $\\_{2}$) , 1 = 2, f$\\_{i}$ = sin, f$\\_{z}$ = cos. This approach has also been used in Random Feature Attention (RFA) [95], with the difference that h ( x ) is set to 1 as the queries and keys are ℓ$\\_{2}$ -normalized before applying the feature map.\nContextualized Text:\nTo approximate the attention mechanism, Performer utilizes random Fourier feature maps, originally used to approximate Gaussian kernels. Specifically, the first version employs trigonometric functions like sine and cosine with h(x) = exp(∥∥^2_L, l_2), where 1 = 2, f_i = sin, and f_z = cos.  Random Feature Attention (RFA) builds upon this by normalizing queries and keys before applying the feature map.	{"tags": ["attention", "transformers", "deep-learning", "approximation"], "doc_id": "53b336be-ad75-41ce-b70e-78dbf98bc905", "summary": "Performer utilizes random Fourier feature maps, originally used to approximate Gaussian kernels, by employing trigonometric functions to approximate attention.

feature map, orthogonality, ReLU, feature space\nKey Objects: Feature Map, Input\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is orthogonality a desirable property in a feature space?\n- How does using ReLU on the input and its negative contribute to orthogonality?\n- In what ways might this feature map improve the performance of attention mechanisms?\n---\nSummary:\nSchlag et al. [113] developed a feature map designed to promote orthogonality in the feature space by defining a partial function utilizing ReLU on a combination of the input and its negative.\nOriginal Text:\nSchlag et al. [113] design a feature map that aims at facilitating orthogonality in feature space. Specifically, given an input x ∈ R $^{D}$, the feature map φ : R D → R 2 V D is defined by the partial function  \n$$\\phi _ { i + 2 } ( j - 1 ) D ( x ) = R e L U ( [ x, - x ] ) ; R e L U ( [ x, - x ] ) _ { i + j } \\ \\ f o r \\ i = 1, \\dots, 2 D, j = 1, \\cdots, v. \\quad ( 1 8 )$$  \n4.2.2 Aggregation Rule. In Eq. (16) the associations { φ ( k ) ∗ ϑ$\\_{j}$ } are aggregated into the memory matrix by simple summation. This is adopted by several studies [18, 19, 62]. However, it could be more beneficial for the network to selectively drop associations as new associations are added to the memory matrix.\nContextualized Text:\nTo enhance attention mechanisms, Schlag et al. [113] created a feature map intended to promote orthogonality within the feature space. This map, defined by a partial function using ReLU applied to a combination of the input and its negative, aims to improve the structure and efficiency of attention models.	{"tags": ["deep-learning", "architecture", "feature engineering"], "doc_id": "eb1fd6db-aca0-4ef0-983e-939b3fd9107e", "summary": "Schlag et al.

gating mechanism, memory matrix, local dependency, RFA\nKey Objects: memory matrix, gating scalar, associations\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is it beneficial to favor recent context when aggregating associations?\n- How does the learnable scalar 'g' contribute to the gating mechanism?\n- What is the impact of the exponential decay of historical associations on the overall performance?\n---\nSummary:\nRFA introduces a gating mechanism to the summation process when adding new associations to the memory matrix, using a learnable scalar 'g' to weight existing associations and new ones, thereby favoring recent context.\nOriginal Text:\nRFA [95] introduces a gating mechanism to the summation to model local dependency in sequence data. Specifically, when adding a new association to the memory matrix S , at a particular time step, they weigh S by a learnable, input-dependent scalar g , and the new association by (1 - g ) (and a similar mechanism to u ). With this modification, history associations are exponentially decayed and recent context is favored in each timestep.\nContextualized Text:\nTo further refine the aggregation of associations within the memory matrix, RFA introduces a gating mechanism.

memory matrix, write-and-remove, gating scalar, association, normalization\nKey Objects: memory matrix, association, gating scalar\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why would simple summation of associations in the memory matrix limit its capacity?\n- How does the 'write-and-remove' approach improve the memory capacity compared to simple summation?\n- What is the purpose of the input-dependent gating scalar in the 'write-and-remove' process?\n---\nSummary:\nSchlag et al. [113] suggest increasing the memory capacity of the system by employing a write-and-remove approach, which involves retrieving, updating, and removing associations within the memory matrix using an input-dependent gating scalar.\nOriginal Text:\nSchlag et al. [113] argue that simple summation limits the capacity of the memory matrix and thus propose to enlarge the capacity in a write-and-remove fashion. Specifically, given a new input key-value pair ( k$\\_{i}$, v$\\_{i}$ ), the model first retrieve the value v$\\_{i}$ currently associated with k$\\_{i}$ using matrix multiplication. It then writes to the memory matrix a convex combination of v$\\_{i}$ and v$\\_{i}$ , using a input-dependent gating scalar g , and removes the association v$\\_{i}$ . They also propose sum normalization ( normalizing φ ( q$\\_{i}$ ) , φ ( k$\\_{i}$ ) by the sum of their components before updating the memory matrix) instead of normalizing with the denominator in Eq. (16) for this aggregation rule.\nContextualized Text:\nTo improve the capacity of the memory matrix, Schlag et al. [113] propose a ‘write-and-remove’ approach. This method addresses limitations of simple summation by retrieving, updating, and removing associations within the matrix using a learnable, input-dependent gating scalar, which influences the convex combination of values.	{"tags": ["architecture", "attention mechanism", "memory", "linearized attention"], "doc_id": "3b8805d8-58c7-467c-9d53-cadb10d20f4d", "summary": "Schlag et al.

sparse attention or kernel-based linearized attention, one could also reduce the complexity of attention by reducing the number of queries or key-value pairs, which leads to query prototyping and memory compression 7 methods, respectively.  \n4.3.1 Attention with Prototype Queries . In query prototyping, several prototypes of queries serve as the main source to compute attention distributions. The model either copies the distributions to the positions of represented queries or filling those positions with discrete uniform distributions. Fig. 8(a) illustrates the computing flow of query prototyping.  \nFig. 8. Query prototyping and memory compression.  \n  \nClustered Attention [138] groups queries into several clusters and then computes attention distributions for cluster centroids. All queries in a cluster share the attention distribution calculated with the corresponding centroid.\nContextualized Text:\nTo reduce the computational complexity of attention mechanisms in Transformer models, query prototyping and memory compression methods can be employed. Query prototyping reduces complexity by using a limited number of query prototypes to compute attention distributions, which are then applied to other queries. For example, Clustered Attention groups queries into clusters and calculates attention distributions for cluster centroids, with all queries in a cluster sharing the same distribution.	{"tags": ["attention", "transformers", "optimization", "NLP"], "doc_id": "c1c11395-9c5d-4877-b686-6be0282fa997", "summary": "Query prototyping and memory compression techniques reduce attention complexity by decreasing the number of queries or key-value pairs, respectively.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Clustered Attention"], "keywords": ["query prototyping", "memory compression", "attention mechanisms", "query prototypes"], "key_objects": ["Queries", "Key-Value Pairs", "Attention Distributions"], "contextual_text": "To reduce the computational complexity of attention mechanisms in Transformer models, query prototyping and memory compression methods can be employed.

title: Query Prototyping and Memory Compression\nTags: prototyping, compression, data-transformation, keys, values\nKey objects: Input, Keys, Values, Prototype, Compressed Values, Prototype Layer, Compression Layer\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates two methods: query prototyping and memory compression. Both diagrams show a process where input data is transformed and processed, with the goal of representing or compressing information. The left side demonstrates query prototyping, while the right depicts memory compression.\nFull description:\nThe diagram shows two processes. In (a), 'Input' is processed and split into two branches labeled 'Keys' and 'Values'. The 'Keys' and 'Values' are then fed into a 'Prototype Layer', which generates a 'Prototype'. In (b), the 'Input' is also split into 'Keys' and 'Values'. These are then fed into a 'Compression Layer', which outputs 'Compressed Values'. Both diagrams showcase distinct approaches to data transformation – one for generating a prototype, and the other for compressing the data into a smaller representation.\nText found in image:\n- (a) Query prototyping\n- (b) Memory compression\n- Input\n- Keys\n- Values\n- Prototype\n- Compressed Values	{"tags": ["prototyping", "compression", "data-transformation", "keys", "values"], "title": "Query Prototyping and Memory Compression", "doc_id": "50683ed8-48c8-4195-9be2-90b468db6950", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_9.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates two methods: query prototyping and memory compression.

Kullback-Leibler divergence, to select prototype queries and assigns discrete uniform distributions to the remaining queries, reducing computational complexity.\nOriginal Text:\nInformer [170] selects prototypes from queries using explicit query sparsity measurement, which is derived from an approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the query's attention distribution and the discrete uniform distribution. Attention distributions are then only calculated for the top-u queries under query sparsity measurement. The rest of the queries are assigned with discrete uniform distributions.  \n4.3.2 Attention with Compressed Key-Value Memory . Apart from decreasing the number of queries with query prototyping, one can also reduce the complexity by reducing the number of the key-value pairs before applying the attention mechanism, as depicted in Fig. 8(b).\nContextualized Text:\nAs a query prototyping technique, Informer selects prototype queries based on a sparsity measurement derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a query's attention distribution and a discrete uniform distribution.

memory compression, strided convolution, global context, attention mechanism\nKey Objects: Keys, Values, Key-Value Memory\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does MCA's use of strided convolution contribute to memory compression?\n- What are the benefits of using MCA in conjunction with local attention?\n- How does MCA compare to other memory compression techniques, such as those used in Set Transformer and Luna?\n---\nSummary:\nMemory Compressed Attention (MCA), proposed by Liu et al. [84], reduces the number of keys and values using a strided convolution to capture global context and process longer sequences.\nOriginal Text:\nLiu et al. [84] propose Memory Compressed Attention (MCA) that reduces the number of keys and values using a strided convolution. This modification is used as a complement to local attention proposed in the same work (as discussed in Sec. 4.1), in that it can capture global context. The mechanism reduces the number of keys and values by a factor of kernel size k and thus allowing to process significantly longer sequences than vanilla Transformer given the same computation resources.  \nSet Transformer [70] and Luna [90] use a number of external trainable global nodes to summarize information from inputs and then the summarized representations serve as a compressed memory that the inputs attend to. This reduces the quadratic complexity of self-attention to linear complexity w.r.t. sequence length.  \n$^{7}$The key-value pairs are often referred to as a key-value memory (hence the name memory compression).\nContextualized Text:\nTo reduce complexity in attention mechanisms, Liu et al. [84] introduced Memory Compressed Attention (MCA). MCA employs a strided convolution to decrease the number of keys and values, allowing the model to capture global context and process longer sequences compared to a standard Transformer.	{"tags": ["attention", "transformers", "compression", "NLP"], "doc_id": "f5a29cce-2cde-4150-929f-17939a0d770f", "summary": "Memory Compressed Attention (MCA), proposed by Liu et al.

key-value memory, linear projections, self-attention, memory compression\nKey Objects: key-value pairs, memory\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is reducing the size of the key-value memory beneficial?\n- What are the trade-offs associated with using linear projections or pooling operations for memory compression?\n- How does the assumption of a fixed input sequence length limit the application of methods like Linformer?\n---\nSummary:\nKey-value pairs in attention mechanisms are often called a key-value memory, and techniques like Linformer and Poolingformer compress this memory to reduce computational complexity.\nOriginal Text:\n$^{7}$The key-value pairs are often referred to as a key-value memory (hence the name memory compression).  \nLinformer [142] utilizes linear projections to project keys and values from length n to a smaller length n$\\_{k}$ . This also reduces the complexity of self-attention to linear. The drawback of this approach is that an input sequence length has to be assumed and hence it cannot be used in autoregressive attention.  \nPoolingformer [165] adopts two-level attention that combines a sliding window attention and a compressed memory attention. The compressed memory module is used after the sliding window attention to increase the receptive field. They explore a few different pooling operations as the compression operation to compress the number of keys and values, including max pooling and pooling with Dynamic Convolution [146].\nContextualized Text:\nIn attention mechanisms, the key-value pairs used in the process are frequently referred to as a key-value memory. To reduce computational complexity, techniques like Linformer and Poolingformer compress this memory. Linformer utilizes linear projections to reduce the size of keys and values, while Poolingformer combines sliding window attention with a compressed memory module using operations like max pooling.	{"tags": ["attention", "transformers", "optimization", "NLP"], "doc_id": "c604e71f-4cdb-4da4-9db6-a5f0c02365c3", "summary": "Key-value pairs in attention mechanisms are often called a key-value memory, and techniques like Linformer and Poolingformer compress this memory to reduce computational complexity.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Linformer", "Poolingformer"], "keywords": ["key-value memory", "linear projections", "self-attention", "memory compression"], "key_objects": ["key-value pairs", "memory"], "contextual_text": "In attention mechanisms, the key-value pairs used in the process are frequently referred to as a key-value memory.

self-attention matrix, represented as A ∈ R T × T, frequently exhibits a low-rank property, leading to two potential strategies: explicit modeling through parameterization or replacement with a low-rank approximation.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.4 Low-rank Self-Attention  \nSome empirical and theoretical analyses [45, 142] report the self-attention matrix A ∈ R T × T is often low-rank 8 . The implications of this property are twofold: (1) The low-rank property could be explicitly modeled with parameterization; (2) The self-attention matrix could be replaced by a low-rank approximation.  \n4.4.1 Low-rank Parameterization. The fact that the rank of the attention matrix is less than sequence length implies that, for scenarios where the inputs are typically short, setting D$\\_{k}$ &gt; T would be more than an over-parameterization and lead to overfitting. It is thus reasonable to limit the dimension of D$\\_{k}$ to explicitly model the low-rank property as an inductive bias. Guo et al. [45] decompose self-attention matrix into a low-rank attention module with small D$\\_{k}$ that captures long-range non-local interactions, and a band attention module that captures local dependencies.\nContextualized Text:\nResearch indicates that the self-attention matrix (A ∈ R T × T) often has a low rank. This characteristic provides opportunities to either explicitly model this property through parameterization or to replace the self-attention matrix with a lower-rank approximation to enhance efficiency and prevent overfitting. Guo et al. demonstrated this by decomposing the attention matrix into modules that handle both long-range dependencies and local relationships.	{"tags": ["attention", "transformers", "optimization", "NLP", "deep-learning"], "doc_id": "a5914a2d-0e87-4132-a797-81240da858ae", "summary": "Empirical and theoretical analyses suggest that the self-attention matrix, represented as A ∈ R T × T, frequently exhibits a low-rank property, leading to two potential strategies: explicit modeling through parameterization or replacement with a low-rank approximation.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Guo et al."], "keywords": ["self-attention", "low-rank approximation", "parameterization", "inductive bias", "long-range interactions", "local dependencies"], "key_objects": ["self-attention matrix", "low-rank approximation", "parameterization", "D_k"], "contextual_text": "Research indicates that the self-attention matrix (A ∈ R T × T) often has a low rank.

Questions:\n- How does the low-rank property of the attention matrix relate to the computational complexity of self-attention?\n- What is the connection between low-rank matrix approximation in self-attention and the approximation of kernel matrices?\n- Can you explain how Performer utilizes random feature maps to approximate Gaussian kernels in the context of

drawing inspiration from kernel matrix approximation techniques.\nOriginal Text:\n4.4.2 Low-rank Approximation. Another implication of the low-rank property of the attention matrix is that one can use a low-rank matrix approximation to reduce the complexity of selfattention. A closely related methodology is the low-rank approximation of kernel matrices. We believe some existing works are inspired by kernel approximation.  \nSome of the aforementioned linearized attention methods in Sec. 4.2 are inspired from kernel approximation with random feature maps. For example, Performer [18] follows the Random Fourier feature map originally proposed to approximate Gaussian kernels. The method first decomposes the attention distribution matrix A into C$\\_{0}$G$\\_{CK}$ K where G is a Gaussian kernel matrix and the random feature map is used to approximate G .\nContextualized Text:\nRecognizing that the attention matrix often possesses a low-rank property, researchers have explored using low-rank matrix approximations as a means to reduce the complexity of self-attention. This approach is closely related to the low-rank approximation of kernel matrices, with methods like Performer drawing inspiration from random feature maps initially developed to approximate Gaussian kernels. Performer decomposes the attention distribution matrix by using a Gaussian kernel matrix and random feature map to approximate it.	{"tags": ["self-attention", "approximation", "complexity", "kernels"], "doc_id": "45741fab-21ae-455a-a007-2a6a53673c01", "summary": "The low-rank property of the attention matrix suggests that low-rank matrix approximations can be employed to reduce the computational complexity of self-attention, drawing inspiration from kernel matrix approximation techniques.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Performer"], "keywords": ["low-rank approximation", "self-attention", "kernel matrices", "random feature maps", "Performer"], "key_objects": ["Attention Matrix", "Kernel Matrices", "Random Feature Maps"], "contextual_text": "Recognizing that the attention matrix often possesses a low-rank property, researchers have explored using low-rank matrix approximations as a means to reduce the complexity of self-attention.

Nystrom method, landmark nodes, approximation, singular matrices, attention computation\nKey Objects: landmark nodes, attention matrix, approximation\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the Nystrom method reduce the computational complexity of self-attention?\n- Why is it important to handle cases where the matrix inverse does not exist in Nystrom-based methods?\n- What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse compared to a regular matrix inverse?\n---\nSummary:\nNystrom-based methods approximate the attention matrix by selecting landmark nodes and using them to compute a simplified attention computation, which is particularly useful when dealing with singular matrices.\nOriginal Text:\nAnother line of work follow the idea of Nystrom method. These Nystrom-based methods [16, 152] first select m landmark nodes from the T inputs with down-sampling methods (e.g., strided average pooling). Let Q , K be the selected landmark queries and keys, then the follow approximation is used in the attention computation  \n$$\\hat { A } =softmax \\left ( \\mathcal { O } _ { K } ^ { T } \\right ) \\left ( \\softmax \\left ( \\mathcal { O } _ { K } ^ { T } \\right ) \\right ) ^ { - 1 } \\text {softmax} \\left ( \\mathcal { O } _ { K } ^ { T } \\right ).$$  \nNote that M - 1 = (softmax ( Q $^{T}$) ) K in Eq. (19) does not always exist. To mitigate this issue, CSALR [16] adds an identity matrix to M to make sure that the inverse always exists. Nystromformer [152] uses the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of M instead of the inverse so that the approximation can be made for cases where M is singular.\nContextualized Text:\nTo exploit the low-rank property of self-attention matrices, some methods employ the Nystrom method. These Nystrom-based methods first select a subset of inputs, termed 'landmark nodes,' and use them to approximate the full attention computation. This allows for efficient attention computation, especially when the original matrix might be singular, a situation addressed by methods like CSALR and Nystromformer which utilize techniques like adding an identity matrix or the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.	{"tags": ["self-attention", "approximation", "methodology", "optimization"], "doc_id": "536f117d-9ed2-490d-98dc-3b01f2d9f064", "summary": "Nystrom-based methods approximate the attention matrix by selecting landmark nodes and using them to compute a simplified attention computation, which is particularly useful when dealing with singular matrices.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["CSALR", "Nystromformer"], "keywords": ["Nystrom method", "landmark nodes", "approximation", "singular matrices", "attention computation"], "key_objects": ["landmark nodes", "attention matrix", "approximation"], "contextual_text": "To exploit the low-rank property of self-attention matrices, some methods employ the Nystrom method.

title: Attention Mechanism Visualization\nTags: attention, mechanism, visualization, neural-networks, transformation\nKey objects: Pre-Attention, Circular Transformation, Final Attention, Grid Structure\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates the evolution of attention weights within a system, showing the difference between pre-attention, an intermediate step represented by a circular transformation, and final attention. The visualization uses a grid-like structure to represent the attention scores at each stage.\nFull description:\nThe diagram displays three stages of an attention mechanism. The first stage, labeled 'pre-attention,' shows a grid with varying levels of intensity, representing initial attention scores.  An intermediate step is shown through a circular transformation. Finally, the last stage, 'final attention', displays a modified grid, showing how the attention weights have changed after the transformation. The color intensity in each grid represents the strength of attention at that particular point.\nText found in image:\n- pre-attention\n- Circular Transformation\n- final attention	{"tags": ["attention", "mechanism", "visualization", "neural-networks", "transformation"], "title": "Attention Mechanism Visualization", "doc_id": "77cfa270-30e3-4e0d-a0b4-239b75a9ef76", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_10.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates the evolution of attention weights within a system, showing the difference between pre-attention, an intermediate step represented by a circular transformation, and final attention.

attention mechanism, prior, attention distribution, softmax, weighted sum\nKey Objects: Attention Distribution, Prior Attention, Attention Scores\nRefers to Images: ./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_10.png\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is the purpose of using a 'prior' in attention mechanisms?\n- How does 'attention with prior' differ from traditional attention mechanisms?\n- Why would one choose to supplement or substitute the distribution generated from inputs?\n---\nSummary:\nAttention mechanisms typically use distributions generated from inputs, but these distributions can also originate from other sources, termed 'prior.' This approach, called 'attention with prior,' allows for supplementation or substitution of input-generated distributions and often involves a weighted sum of prior and generated attention scores before applying softmax.\nOriginal Text:\n  \ngenerated from inputs (e.g., softmax( OK $^{T}$) in vanilla Transformer). As a generalized case, attention distribution can also come from other sources, which we refer to as prior . Prior attention distribution can be a supplement or substitute for distribution generated from inputs. We abstract this formulation of attention as attention with prior , as depicted in Fig. 9. In most cases, the fusion of two attention distribution can be done by computing a weighted sum of the scores corresponding to the prior and generated attention before applying softmax.\nContextualized Text:\nIn Transformer models, attention mechanisms often utilize attention distributions generated from inputs, such as through a softmax function. However, these distributions can also be derived from other sources, referred to as a 'prior.' This technique, known as 'attention with prior,' allows for supplementation or substitution of distributions derived directly from the inputs. A common implementation involves computing a weighted sum of the prior and generated attention scores before applying a softmax function.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "attention"], "doc_id": "fe8c140f-4f59-4dbe-8bbd-4fbf74502256", "summary": "Attention mechanisms typically use distributions generated from inputs, but these distributions can also originate from other sources, termed 'prior.'

title: Attention Mechanism Visualization\nTags: attention, neural-network, visualization, dataflow\nKey objects: Pre-Attention, Attention Process, Final Attention, Grid Representation\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates a visual representation of the attention mechanism focusing on how attention weights change across different stages: pre-attention, during the attention process, and the final calculated attention. It showcases the evolution of the attention scores as the information flows through the model.\nFull description:\nThe diagram presents three stages of an attention mechanism visualized as a grid. The first stage, labeled 'pre-attention', displays an initial distribution of weights represented by blue color intensity in a grid.  The second stage, 'attention process,' shows how these weights are modified during the attention calculation. This stage depicts how blue intensity shifts and changes location on the grid.  The third stage, 'final attention,' showcases the final computed attention weights after processing, again shown as blue intensity within a grid. The arrows between stages show the data flow from pre-attention to the process and finally to the final attention stage.\nText found in image:\n- pre-attention\n- attention process\n- final attention	{"tags": ["attention", "neural-network", "visualization", "dataflow"], "title": "Attention Mechanism Visualization", "doc_id": "adb8a305-ca80-43b6-8272-9e5fe0ed87c2", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_10.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates a visual representation of the attention mechanism focusing on how attention weights change across different stages: pre-attention, during the attention process, and the final calculated attention.

locality, Gaussian distribution, prior attention, attention mechanism\nKey Objects: Gaussian distribution, positions, attention scores\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does encoding locality as a prior attention improve the attention mechanism?\n- Why is a Gaussian distribution a suitable choice for representing locality?\n- What is the purpose of predicting a central position for each query?\n---\nSummary:\nSome data types, like text, often demonstrate a preference for locality, which can be incorporated into the attention mechanism by using a prior attention based on a Gaussian distribution over positions.\nOriginal Text:\n4.5.1 Prior that Models locality. Some types of data (e.g., text) can exhibit a strong preference for the locality. This property can be explicitly encoded as a prior attention. A simple method would be to use a Gaussian distribution over positions. Specifically, one could multiply the generated attention distribution with some Gaussian density and then normalize, which is equivalent to adding to the generated attention scores A a bias term G , where higher G$\\_{ij}$ indicates a higher prior probability that the i -th input attend to the j -th input.  \nYang et al. [156] proposes to first predict a central position p$\\_{i}$ for each q$\\_{i}$ using a simple feedforward network. The Gaussian bias is then defined to be  \n$$G _ { i j } = - \\frac { ( j - p _ { i } ) ^ { 2 } } { 2 \\sigma _ { 2 } }$$  \nwhere σ denotes standard deviation for the Gaussian and can be determined as a hyperparameter or predicted from inputs.\nContextualized Text:\nTo account for the tendency of some data types, such as text, to exhibit locality, a 'prior attention' can be implemented. One method uses a Gaussian distribution over positions to encode this preference. Specifically, the generated attention distribution can be multiplied with a Gaussian density and normalized. This is equivalent to adding a bias term, G, to the generated attention scores, where higher Gᵢⱼ values signify a greater prior probability that the i-th input attends to the j-th input.	{"tags": ["attention", "locality", "transformer", "NLP"], "doc_id": "5d81ca15-9d7a-444a-ba72-7a26719b2923", "summary": "Some data types, like text, often demonstrate a preference for locality, which can be incorporated into the attention mechanism by using a prior attention based on a Gaussian distribution over positions.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Yang et al.", "Gaussian Transformer"], "keywords": ["locality", "Gaussian distribution", "prior attention", "attention mechanism"], "key_objects": ["Gaussian distribution", "positions", "attention scores"], "contextual_text": "To account for the tendency of some data types, such as text, to exhibit locality, a 'prior attention' can be implemented.

Gaussian distribution, attention bias, central position, deviation\nKey Objects: Gaussian bias, central position, scalar parameters\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does defining a Gaussian bias help the Transformer model focus attention?\n- What is the purpose of the 'w' and 'b' parameters in the Gaussian bias formula?\n- Why is it advantageous to assume the central position to be 'i' for each query?\n---\nSummary:\nGaussian Transformer models the central position of each query as itself and defines a bias to focus attention, using scalar parameters 'w' and 'b' to control deviation and reduce the weight for the central position.\nOriginal Text:\nwhere σ denotes standard deviation for the Gaussian and can be determined as a hyperparameter or predicted from inputs.  \nGaussian Transformer [42] assumes the central position to be i for each q$\\_{i}$ and defines the bias to bes  \n$$G _ { i j } = - | w ( i - j ) ^ { 2 } + b |,$$  \nwhere w ≥ 0 , b ≤ 0 are scalar parameters that controls the deviation and reduce the weight for central position, respectively.  \n4.5.2 Prior from Lower Modules. In Transformer architecture, it is often observed the attention distributions are similar in adjacent layers. It is thus natural to provide attention distribution from previous layer as a prior for attention computation. The final attention scores can be defined as  \n$$\\hat { A } ^ { ( l ) } = w _ { 1 } \\cdot \\hat { A } ^ { ( l ) } + w _ { 2 } \\cdot g ( \\hat { A } ^ { ( l - 1 ) } )$$\nContextualized Text:\nTo explicitly encode locality preferences, some approaches utilize a Gaussian distribution as a prior attention. Gaussian Transformer assumes that the central position for each query is itself and introduces a bias to focus attention. This bias is defined by a formula involving scalar parameters 'w' and 'b', which control the deviation and reduce the weight for the central position, respectively.	{"tags": ["attention", "transformer", "architecture", "NLP"], "doc_id": "d883d9df-4240-4ee9-b563-d9c76a9c74f6", "summary": "Gaussian Transformer models the central position of each query as itself and defines a bias to focus attention, using scalar parameters 'w' and 'b' to control deviation and reduce the weight for the central position.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Gaussian Transformer"], "keywords": ["Gaussian distribution", "attention bias", "central position", "deviation"], "key_objects": ["Gaussian bias", "central position", "scalar parameters"], "contextual_text": "To explicitly encode locality preferences, some approaches utilize a Gaussian distribution as a prior attention.

attention mechanism, prior attention, convolutional layer, Transformer architecture\nKey Objects: Attention Scores, Transformer Layers, Convolutional Layer\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the function 'g' influence the final attention scores?\n- What are the benefits of using a convolutional layer as the 'g' function?\n- In what situations would a prior attention mechanism be most advantageous?\n---\nSummary:\nIn Transformer architectures, a prior attention mechanism can be introduced by combining attention scores from the current layer with those from a previous layer. This is achieved by weighting the current attention scores and transforming previous layer scores using a function, allowing for the incorporation of prior information into the attention process.\nOriginal Text:\n$$\\hat { A } ^ { ( l ) } = w _ { 1 } \\cdot \\hat { A } ^ { ( l ) } + w _ { 2 } \\cdot g ( \\hat { A } ^ { ( l - 1 ) } )$$  \nwhere A ( l ) denotes the attention scores of the l -th layer, w$\\_{1}$, w$\\_{2}$ ∈ R are weight applied to the scores from adjacent layers, and g : R n × n → R n × n is a function that translate previous scores to the prior to be applied.  \nPredictive Attention Transformer [143] proposes to apply a 2D-convolutional layer to previous attention scores and compute the final attention scores as a convex combination of the generated attention scores and the convolved scores. This is equivalent to setting w$\\_{1}$ = α, w$\\_{2}$ = 1 - α and g ( · ) to be a convolutional layer in Eq. (22). They experiment training such a model from scratch and finetune after adapting the pre-trained BERT model, and both sets of experiments show improvements over baseline models.\nContextualized Text:\nTo incorporate prior information, Transformer architectures combine attention scores from the current layer (A^(l)) with those from a previous layer.  The combined attention scores are calculated as a weighted sum where w₁ and w₂ are weights applied to the scores and g is a function transforming previous layer scores to act as a prior. For example, the Predictive Attention Transformer utilizes a 2D-convolutional layer (g) to transform the previous attention scores, creating a convex combination with the current scores.	{"tags": ["NLP", "deep-learning", "architecture", "attention"], "doc_id": "9aa282ee-8470-4b85-9b82-729f9799eb51", "summary": "In Transformer architectures, a prior attention mechanism can be introduced by combining attention scores from the current layer with those from a previous layer.

attention mechanism, residual connection, Realformer, BERT\nKey Objects: attention scores, attention maps\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why might adding previous attention scores improve performance?\n- How does the residual skip connection on attention maps contribute to Realformer's efficiency?\n- What are the benefits of Realformer surpassing the baseline BERT model with reduced pre-training?\n---\nSummary:\nRealformer utilizes a technique where previous attention scores are directly added to the current, generated attention scores, functionally acting as a residual skip connection on the attention maps.\nOriginal Text:\nRealformer [51] uses adds the previous attention scores directly to the generated attention scores, thus resembles a residual skip connection on attention maps. It's equivalent to setting w$\\_{1}$ = w$\\_{2}$ = 1 and g ( · ) to be identity map in Eq. (22). They conduct pre-training experiments on this model. The results show that this model outperforms the baseline BERT model in multiple datasets and surpasses the baseline model even when pre-training budgets are significantly lower.\nContextualized Text:\nTo leverage information from previous layers, Realformer [51] directly adds the previous attention scores to the generated attention scores. This is analogous to a residual skip connection on the attention maps, allowing the model to benefit from prior contextual information. This approach was demonstrated through pre-training experiments, revealing that Realformer outperformed baseline BERT models, even with reduced pre-training budgets.	{"tags": ["architecture", "transformers", "attention"], "doc_id": "ea58ea56-5817-44ac-a1ab-eca5be052b83", "summary": "Realformer utilizes a technique where previous attention scores are directly added to the current, generated attention scores, functionally acting as a residual skip connection on the attention maps.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Realformer", "BERT"], "keywords": ["attention mechanism", "residual connection", "Realformer", "BERT"], "key_objects": ["attention scores", "attention maps"], "contextual_text": "To leverage information from previous layers, Realformer [51] directly adds the previous attention scores to the generated attention scores.

attention maps, computation cost, lazyformer, layer sharing\nKey Objects: attention maps, layers\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does sharing attention maps impact the model's ability to capture complex relationships?\n- What are the potential drawbacks of sharing attention maps across layers?\n- In what scenarios would sharing attention maps be most beneficial?\n---\nSummary:\nLazyformer proposes a method to reduce computational cost by sharing attention maps across adjacent layers, effectively reusing calculated attention maps.\nOriginal Text:\nAs an extreme case, Lazyformer [159] proposes to share attention maps between a number of adjacent layers. This is equivalent to setting g ( · ) to identity and switch the settings of w$\\_{1}$ = 0 , w$\\_{2}$ = 1 and w$\\_{1}$ = 1 , w$\\_{2}$ = 0 alternatingly. The benefit of this approach is that the attention maps are computed only once and reused several times in the succeeding layers, thus reducing the computation cost. Their pre-training experiments show that the resulting model remains effective while being much more efficient to compute.  \n4.5.3 Prior as Multi-task Adapters. Adapters are task-dependent, trainable modules that are attached in specific locations of a pre-trained network for cross-task efficient parameter sharing [108]. Pilault et al. [98] propose a Conditionally Adaptive Multi-Task Learning (CAMTL) framework that uses a trainable attention prior M ( z$\\_{i}$ ) that depends on task encoding z$\\_{i}$ ∈ R D$\\_{z}$\nContextualized Text:\nTo further optimize computation, Lazyformer introduces a technique where attention maps are shared between adjacent layers.

A maximum sequence length n$\\_{max}$ is specified in implementation. The prior is formulated as a block diagonal matrix and added to the attention scores of upper layers in pre-trained Transformers to serve as an adapter for parameter-efficient multi-task inductive knowledge transfer.  \n4.5.4 Attention with Only Prior. Some works have explored using an attention distribution that is independent of pair-wise interaction between inputs. In other words, their models exploit only a prior attention distribution.\nContextualized Text:\nTo facilitate parameter-efficient multi-task inductive knowledge transfer, some models employ trainable modules called adapters. These adapters introduce a prior attention distribution based on a task encoding (zᵢ). The adapters, formulated as a block diagonal matrix, are then added to the attention scores of upper layers within pre-trained Transformers.	{"tags": ["NLP", "deep-learning", "transformers", "adaptation", "transfer learning"], "doc_id": "a6cc485f-6332-4882-b555-a1ff3fb05cf5", "summary": "Some approaches utilize task-dependent, trainable modules called adapters to introduce a prior attention distribution based on task encoding.

average attention network, discrete uniform distribution, Transformer decoder, parallel training, RNN\nKey Objects: attention network, discrete uniform distribution, Transformer decoder\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why would using a discrete uniform distribution for attention simplify the decoding process?\n- What benefits does a cumulative average attention mechanism offer over traditional pairwise attention?\n- How does the addition of a feed-forward gating layer improve the expressiveness of the average attention network?\n---\nSummary:\nZhang et al. introduced the average attention network, a Transformer decoder variant that utilizes a discrete uniform distribution as the only source of attention, which allows for parallel training and RNN-like decoding, avoiding quadratic complexity.\nOriginal Text:\nZhang et al. [164] design an efficient Transformer decoder variant called average attention network that uses a discrete uniform distribution as the sole source of attention distribution. The values are thus aggregated as a cumulative-average of all values. To improve the expressiveness of the network, they further adds a feed-forward gating layer on top of the average attention module. The advantage of this approach is that the adapted Transformer decoder can train in a parallel manner as usual Transformers do and decode like an RNN, thus avoiding the O ( T $^{2}$) complexity in decoding.\nContextualized Text:\nTo explore attention distributions completely independent of input interaction, Zhang et al. [164] designed an efficient Transformer decoder variant called the average attention network. This network uses a discrete uniform distribution as the sole source of attention, aggregating values as a cumulative average. To enhance expressiveness, a feed-forward gating layer is added. A key advantage is that this adapted Transformer decoder can be trained in parallel and decodes like an RNN, thereby avoiding the O(T²) complexity common in decoding.	{"tags": ["architecture", "efficiency", "decoding", "transformer"], "doc_id": "e87835a2-c10d-40fb-b3c0-e846fbc1a6a6", "summary": "Zhang et al. introduced the average attention network, a Transformer decoder variant that utilizes a discrete uniform distribution as the only source of attention, which allows for parallel training and RNN-like decoding, avoiding quadratic complexity.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer", "RNN"], "keywords": ["average attention network", "discrete uniform distribution", "Transformer decoder", "parallel training", "RNN"], "key_objects": ["attention network", "discrete uniform distribution", "Transformer decoder"], "contextual_text": "To explore attention distributions completely independent of input interaction, Zhang et al.

Gaussian distribution, attention distribution, machine translation, self-attention\nKey Objects: Gaussian distribution, attention distribution, self-attention\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why would researchers choose to eliminate generated attention altogether?\n- How does the use of a Gaussian distribution contribute to focusing attention on a local window?\n- What are the potential advantages of using hardcoded attention compared to traditional attention mechanisms?\n---\nSummary:\nYou et al. [161] explored using a Gaussian distribution as the sole attention distribution, eliminating the need for generated attention, and demonstrated comparable performance to baseline models in machine translation tasks.\nOriginal Text:\nYou et al. [161] utilize a Gaussian distribution as the hardcoded attention distribution for attention calculation. The intuition is very similar to Yang et al. [156] and Guo et al. [42] in that attention distribution should be focused on a certain local window. Distinctively, they drop the generated attention completely and use only the Gaussian distribution for attention computation. In this approach, the mean (central position) and variance are designed to be hyperparameters. The experiments show that the hardcoded attention, when applied only to self-attention, can achieve comparable performance to the baseline model in machine translation tasks.\nContextualized Text:\nResearchers, such as You et al. [161], have investigated using pre-defined attention distributions to enhance Transformer models. Specifically, they utilized a Gaussian distribution as the sole attention distribution, dispensing with the typically generated attention. This approach, drawing on the intuitions of earlier works by Yang et al. [156] and Guo et al. [42], posits that focusing attention on a localized area can be beneficial. The study found that this hardcoded attention method, applied solely to self-attention, achieved results comparable to those of baseline models in machine translation tasks.	{"tags": ["NLP", "transformers", "attention mechanism", "machine translation"], "doc_id": "e7d81646-c373-4f7f-b917-243f1620f9b9", "summary": "You et al.

attention mechanism, machine translation, language modeling, synthesizer\nKey Objects: attention scores, feed-forward network\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why would randomly initialized attention scores be effective?\n- What are the potential benefits of using a feed-forward network to generate attention scores?\n- What might be the underlying reason for the effectiveness of these non-traditional attention methods?\n---\nSummary:\nThe Synthesizer model, as described in [131], explores replacing the usual generated attention scores with either learnable, randomly initialized scores or scores from a feed-forward network conditioned only on the querying input, demonstrating competitive performance in machine translation and language modeling.\nOriginal Text:\nSynthesizer [131] proposes to replace generated attention scores with: (1) a learnable, randomly initialized attention scores, and (2) attention scores output by a feed-forward network that is only conditioned on the querying input itself. The experiments on machine translation and language modeling show that these variants can achieve competitive performance with vanilla Transformer. It is not explained why these variants work but the empirical results are intriguing.\nContextualized Text:\nAs part of exploring attention mechanisms, the Synthesizer model [131] investigates an unconventional approach. It proposes replacing the typically generated attention scores with either learnable, randomly initialized scores or scores output by a feed-forward network that is only influenced by the input query itself.  Remarkably, this alternative demonstrates competitive results in tasks such as machine translation and language modeling, despite the underlying reasons for its success remaining unclear.	{"tags": ["NLP", "transformers", "attention"], "doc_id": "db59608c-cf5c-4328-ad24-20bbacd5c4b0", "summary": "The Synthesizer model, as described in [131], explores replacing the usual generated attention scores with either learnable, randomly initialized scores or scores from a feed-forward network conditioned only on the querying input, demonstrating competitive performance in machine translation and language modeling.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Synthesizer", "Transformer"], "keywords": ["attention mechanism", "machine translation", "language modeling", "synthesizer"], "key_objects": ["attention scores", "feed-forward network"], "contextual_text": "As part of exploring attention mechanisms, the Synthesizer model [131] investigates an unconventional approach.

there's a challenge in ensuring that each attention head captures distinct features.\nOriginal Text:\n### 4.6 Improved Multi-Head Mechanism  \nMulti-head attention is appealing for the ability to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. However, there is no mechanism to guarantee that different attention heads indeed capture distinct features.  \n4.6.1 Head Behavior Modeling. A basic motivation for using multi-head attention is to allow the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions [137]. However, in vanilla Transformer there is no explicit mechanism to guarantee different behavior across attention heads, nor is there any mechanism for heads to interact with each other. A line of work is dedicated to improving multi-head mechanism by introducing incorporating more sophisticated mechanisms that guide the behavior of different attention heads or allow interaction across attention heads.\nContextualized Text:\nIn multi-head attention, a key goal is to allow models to attend to different representation subspaces. However, in the vanilla Transformer, there's no built-in mechanism to guarantee that each attention head behaves distinctly or interacts with others. This has led to research focused on improving the multi-head mechanism by introducing more sophisticated approaches.	{"tags": ["NLP", "deep-learning", "architecture", "transformer"], "doc_id": "b33b8f9e-db44-48e2-8492-ac8dadddfbd4", "summary": "Multi-head attention is designed to allow models to attend to information from different representation subspaces, but there's a challenge in ensuring that each attention head captures distinct features.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["multi-head attention", "representation subspaces", "attention heads"], "key_objects": ["attention heads", "representation subspaces", "multi-head attention"], "contextual_text": "In multi-head attention, a key goal is to allow models to attend to different representation subspaces.

attention heads, regularization, cosine distances, diversity\nKey Objects: attention heads, loss function\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is it important to encourage diversity among attention heads?\n- How does maximizing cosine distances contribute to diversity in attention heads?\n- What is the purpose of dispersing the positions attended by multiple

[73] introduced a regularization term to the loss function that encourages diversity among attention heads by maximizing cosine distances and dispersing attended positions.\nOriginal Text:\nLi et al. [73] introduce an auxiliary disagreement regularization term into loss function to encourage diversity among different attention heads. Two regularization terms are respectively to maximize cosine distances of the input subspaces and output representations, while the last one is to disperse the positions attended by multiple heads with element-wise multiplication of the corresponding attention matrices.\nContextualized Text:\nTo improve multi-head attention, Li et al. [73] introduced an auxiliary disagreement regularization term into the loss function. This term encourages diversity among different attention heads by maximizing cosine distances between input subspaces and output representations, and by dispersing the positions attended by multiple heads using element-wise multiplication of their attention matrices.	{"tags": ["architecture", "optimization", "NLP"], "doc_id": "96c4be5d-d5d9-48e5-b892-f8fbebbe6a91", "summary": "Li et al.

self-attention, Transformer, BERT, auxiliary loss, Talking-head Attention\nKey Objects: attention heads, attention patterns\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why do self-attention patterns in pre-trained Transformers sometimes lack linguistic backing?\n- How do auxiliary losses help improve the training of Transformer models?\n- What is the core motivation behind Talking-head Attention?\n---\nSummary:\nSome studies have shown that pre-trained Transformer models exhibit self-attention patterns that do not always align with linguistic principles. To address this, researchers have introduced constraints, such as auxiliary losses and specific attention mechanisms like Talking-head Attention, to improve Transformer training.\nOriginal Text:\nSeveral probing works have revealed that pre-trained Transformer models exhibit certain patterns of self-attention that are of little linguistic backing. As a representative work, Kovaleva et al. [68] identify several simple attention patterns in BERT. For instance, many of the attention heads simply pay attention to special BERT tokens [CLS] and [SEP]. As a result, some constraints can be introduced to boost the training of Transformer models. To this end, Deshpande and Narasimhan [27] propose to use an auxiliary loss, which is defined to be the Frobenius norm between attention distribution maps and predefined attention patterns.  \nTalking-head Attention [119] uses a talking head mechanism that linearly projects the generated attention scores from h$\\_{k}$ to h$\\_{k}$ heads, applies softmax in that space, and then projects to h$\\_{k}$ heads for value aggregation. The motivation is to encourage the model to move information between attention heads in a learnable fashion.\nContextualized Text:\nResearchers have observed that pre-trained Transformer models sometimes exhibit self-attention patterns that lack strong linguistic grounding. To rectify this, methods like introducing auxiliary losses and utilizing techniques such as Talking-head Attention have been proposed to refine and improve the training process of Transformer models.	{"tags": ["NLP", "transformers", "attention", "training"], "doc_id": "f70af643-7637-4cc9-bf4d-407ded33e403", "summary": "Some studies have shown that pre-trained Transformer models exhibit self-attention patterns that do not always align with linguistic principles.

multi-head attention, query projection, key projection, mixing vector, collaborative attention\nKey Objects: Query Projection, Key Projection, Mixing Vector, Attention Heads\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is the purpose of sharing query and key projections in Collaborative Multi-head Attention?\n- How does the mixing vector contribute to the filtering of projection parameters?\n- What potential benefits might arise from adapting Eq.

(3) to achieve a specific attention outcome.\nOriginal Text:\nCollaborative Multi-head Attention [21] uses shared query and key projection W Q and W K and a mixing vector m$\\_{i}$ for the i -th head to filter from the projection parameters such that Eq. (3) is adapted to  \n$$\\mathbf h _ { k } = \\mathbf A \\mathbf t e t { \\mathbf T i n a n d } ( Q W ^ { Q } \\partial g _ { i } ( m _ { i } ), K W ^ { K }, V W ^ { V } _ { i } ),$$  \nwhere W Q and W K are shared by all the attention heads.  \n4.6.2 Multi-head with Restricted Spans. Vanilla attention adopts full attention spans assume, where a query can attend to all of the key-value pairs. However, it is often observed that some heads focus their attention distribution mainly in a local context while some other heads attend to broader contexts. It could thus be beneficial to restrict the attention spans:  \n- · Locality. Restricting attention spans induce explicit local constraints. This is advantageous in cases where locality is an important prior.\nContextualized Text:\nTo improve upon standard multi-head attention, Collaborative Multi-head Attention [21] uses shared query and key projections (W Q and W K) and a mixing vector (mᵢ) for each head to filter projection parameters. This adaptation of Eq. (3) aims to refine the attention process by encouraging heads to focus on relevant features.	{"tags": ["architecture", "attention", "transformers", "NLP"], "doc_id": "f7991b73-b9a6-45a7-8fe9-7c3985081ebd", "summary": "Collaborative Multi-head Attention [21] introduces a method where query and key projections (W Q and W K) are shared across all attention heads, along with a mixing vector (mᵢ) to filter projection parameters, adapting Eq.

attention spans, locality, efficiency, masking\nKey Objects: attention spans, mask\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is locality an important consideration in attention mechanisms?\n- How does restricting attention spans contribute to the efficiency of Transformer models?\n- What is the role of the mask value in restricting attention spans?\n---\nSummary:\nRestricting attention spans in Transformer models can improve locality and efficiency, allowing for scaling to longer sequences. This is achieved by multiplying attention distribution values with a mask, which can be learned or fixed.\nOriginal Text:\n- · Locality. Restricting attention spans induce explicit local constraints. This is advantageous in cases where locality is an important prior.\n- · Efficiency. If implemented appropriately, such a model can scale to very long sequences without introducing additional memory footprint and computational time.  \nRestricting attention spans can be expressed as multiplying each attention distribution value with a mask value and then re-normalize, where the mask can be expressed as a non-increasing function that maps a distance to a value in [0, 1]. A vanilla attention assigns a mask value of 1 for all distances, as depicted in Fig. 10(a).  \nSukhbaatar et al. [126] propose to use a learnable attention span, as depicted in Fig. 10(b) . The mask is parameterized by a learnable scalar z and a hyperparameter R . The experiments on  \nFig. 10. Three types of span masking function m ( x ) . The horizontal axis represents distance x and vertical axis the mask value.\nContextualized Text:\nTo improve performance and scalability in Transformer models, techniques restricting attention spans are used. Restricting attention spans induce explicit local constraints and allow models to efficiently process longer sequences. This approach involves multiplying attention distribution values with a mask, which can be either learned or fixed to control the attention range.	{"tags": ["NLP", "deep-learning", "architecture", "efficiency"], "doc_id": "0a2b6342-2fee-4555-939a-e30b6c63e21b", "summary": "Restricting attention spans in Transformer models can improve locality and efficiency, allowing for scaling to longer sequences.

attention span, language modeling, hierarchical features, adaptive span\nKey Objects: attention span, adaptive-span models, language models\nRefers to Images: ./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_11.png\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does using a learnable attention span improve language modeling performance?\n- What is the significance of the observation that lower layers have smaller learned spans and higher layers have larger spans?\n- Why is it beneficial to reduce the number of floating-point operations (FLOPS) during language modeling?\n---\nSummary:\nAdaptive-span models, which use learnable attention spans, have been shown to outperform baseline models in character-level language modeling while requiring fewer floating-point operations (FLOPS). These models also exhibit a hierarchical composition of features, with lower layers having smaller spans and higher layers having larger spans.\nOriginal Text:\nFig. 10. Three types of span masking function m ( x ) . The horizontal axis represents distance x and vertical axis the mask value.  \n  \ncharacter-level language modeling show that the adaptive-span models outperform baseline models while having significantly fewer FLOPS. It is also observed that lower layers generally have smaller learned spans and higher layers otherwise. This indicates that the model can learn a hierarchical composition of features.\nContextualized Text:\nSeveral techniques have been explored to restrict the attention spans within Transformer models. Adaptive-span models, which utilize learnable attention spans, demonstrate improved performance in character-level language modeling, achieving better results with fewer FLOPS.  Furthermore, these models reveal a hierarchical feature composition, indicated by smaller learned spans in lower layers and larger spans in higher layers.	{"tags": ["attention", "transformers", "NLP", "architecture", "modeling"], "doc_id": "67fb171b-6622-4fb3-a9c0-e0c2e44e1d2d", "summary": "Adaptive-span models, which use learnable attention spans, have been shown to outperform baseline models in character-level language modeling while requiring fewer floating-point operations (FLOPS).

title: Mask Functions for Attention Mechanisms\nTags: attention, masking, sequence, neural-network, NLP\nKey objects: Vanilla Attention Mask, Adaptive Mask, Fixed Span Mask, Input Sequence, Output Sequence, Masked Area, Unmasked Area\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates three different mask functions used in attention mechanisms. The first shows a mask for vanilla attention, the second depicts a mask function for adaptive mask, and the third shows a mask function for fixed span.\nFull description:\nThe diagram presents three different masking functions applied to sequences. The first plot, labeled 'vanilla attention', shows a constant value (representing a mask) followed by a sharp drop to zero, indicating that the sequence up to that point is masked and cannot be attended to. The second plot, 'adaptive mask', starts with a high value, then linearly drops to zero. The third graph, 'fixed span mask', depicts a flat line at a high value and then goes flat again, representing a region where the sequence is fully unmasked and then re-masked.\nText found in image:\n- mask function for vanilla attention\n- mask function for adaptive mask\n- mask function for fixed span\n- input sequence\n- output sequence	{"tags": ["attention", "masking", "sequence", "neural-network", "NLP"], "title": "Mask Functions for Attention Mechanisms", "doc_id": "0b7b6821-f4ab-432e-bcc5-d9fb3a87cacb", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_11.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates three different mask functions used in attention mechanisms.

attention span, fixed attention, scale value, Multi-Scale Transformer\nKey Objects: attention spans, layers, scale value\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does varying the attention span across layers contribute to the Transformer's ability to process information?\n- What is the linguistic rationale behind using larger attention spans in higher layers?\n- How does limiting the attention span improve inference speed on long sequences?\n---\nSummary:\nMulti-Scale Transformer introduces a method of using fixed attention spans, varying the maximum span for different heads across layers, to control the attention window and optimize performance.\nOriginal Text:\nMulti-Scale Transformer [44] proposes to use a fixed attention span, with different heads in different layers using a different max span. The fixed attention span is depicted in Fig. 10(c). The attention is restricted within a fixed window which is controlled by a scale value w . They design the scales from an intuitive linguistic perspective and empirical observation from BERT such that higher layers tend to have more large scales (e.g., large span size), and lower layers should be confined with a smaller scale. Their experiments on several tasks show that the model can outperform baseline models while accelerating inference on long sequences.\nContextualized Text:\nTo manage the scope of attention, Multi-Scale Transformer uses fixed attention spans.

multi-head attention, aggregation, linear transformation, re-parameterization\nKey Objects: Attention Head, Weight Matrix, Linear Transformation\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is the concatenation-and-project method equivalent to a summation of attention outputs?\n- How does dividing the weight matrix (W O) into blocks facilitate the aggregation process?\n- Could alternative aggregation methods, beyond concatenation and linear transformation, potentially improve multi-head attention?\n---\nSummary:\nVanilla multi-head attention combines the outputs of individual attention heads by concatenating them and applying a linear transformation, which is mathematically equivalent to a summation of re-parameterized attention outputs. This process involves dividing a weight matrix into blocks to achieve this aggregation.\nOriginal Text:\n4.6.3 Multi-head with Refined Aggregation . After each attention head computes its output representation, the vanilla multi-head attention [137] concatenates these representation and then apply a linear transformation to the concatenated representation to obtain the final output representation, as formulated in Eq. (2). Combining Eq. (1)(2) and (3), one can see that this concatenate-and-project formulation is equivalent to summation over H re-parameterized attention outputs. To this end, we first divide W O ∈$\\_{R}$ D$\\_{m}$ × D m into H blocks  \n$$W O = [ W _ { 0 } ^ { o }, W _ { 0 } ^ { o }, \\cdots ; W _ { O } ^ { o } ],$$  \nwhere each W O i is of dimension D$\\_{u}$ × D$\\_{m}$ . It's thus easy to see that multi-head attention can be reformulated as  \n$$M u l t i h e A t t { n } ( Q, K, V ) = \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { H } \\text {Attention} ( Q W _ { i } ^ { o }, K W _ { i } ^ { o }, V W _ { i } ^ { o } W _ { o } ).$$\nContextualized Text:\nIn vanilla multi-head attention, after each attention head computes its output, these outputs are combined. Specifically, the outputs are concatenated and a linear transformation is applied to obtain the final output representation. This aggregation process is mathematically equivalent to summing the outputs of each attention head.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "attention"], "doc_id": "105c28b4-afc6-413e-ae73-0d070559a875", "summary": "Vanilla multi-head attention combines the outputs of individual attention heads by concatenating them and applying a linear transformation, which is mathematically equivalent to a summation of re-parameterized attention outputs.

multi-head attention, aggregation, expressiveness, summation\nKey Objects: multi-head attention, outputs\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are the limitations of the summation approach for aggregating attention heads?\n- How might more complex aggregation methods improve the performance of multi-head attention?\n- What are some examples of alternative aggregation techniques that could be used?\n---\nSummary:\nThe standard multi-head attention mechanism aggregates outputs by summation, but some researchers argue this is a simplistic approach that doesn't fully utilize the potential expressiveness of the mechanism.\nOriginal Text:\n$$M u l t i h e A t t { n } ( Q, K, V ) = \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { H } \\text {Attention} ( Q W _ { i } ^ { o }, K W _ { i } ^ { o }, V W _ { i } ^ { o } W _ { o } ).$$  \nOne might argue that this simple aggregate-by-summation paradigm does not fully exploit the expressiveness of multi-head attention and that it is more desirable to use a more complex aggregation.\nContextualized Text:\nIn multi-head attention, after the attention heads compute their individual outputs, these outputs are typically combined using a simple summation approach.

multi-head attention, aggregation, routing methods, capsule networks, dynamic routing, EM routing\nKey Objects: attention heads, routing mechanisms, output capsules\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why might the simple summation method for aggregating attention heads be considered limiting?\n- How are capsule networks and routing methods being applied to improve multi-head attention?\n- What are the trade-offs associated with using routing methods in multi-head attention, and why is applying them only to lower layers often preferred?\n---\nSummary:\nSome researchers argue that the standard summation method for aggregating outputs from multiple attention heads in multi-head attention may not fully utilize the mechanism's expressiveness. They propose using routing methods, inspired by capsule networks, to aggregate information, with lower layer routing offering a balance between performance and computational cost.\nOriginal Text:\nOne might argue that this simple aggregate-by-summation paradigm does not fully exploit the expressiveness of multi-head attention and that it is more desirable to use a more complex aggregation.  \nGu and Feng [40], Li et al. [74] propose to use routing methods, originally proposed for capsule networks [112], to further aggregate information produced by different attention heads. The outputs of attention heads are first transformed into input capsules, then output capsules are obtained after the iterative routing process. The output capsules are then concatenated as a final output of multi-head attention. These two works both utilizes two routing mechanisms, namely dynamic routing [112] and EM routing [53]. One would notice that iterative routing introduces additional parameters and computational overhead. Li et al. [74] empirically show that applying the routing mechanism only to the lower layers can best balance the translation performance and computational efficiency.\nContextualized Text:\nWithin multi-head attention, the standard practice of summing the outputs from individual attention heads is sometimes viewed as a limiting factor in fully leveraging the mechanism’s capabilities. To address this, researchers have explored alternative aggregation methods, such as routing mechanisms adapted from capsule networks. These routing methods transform the outputs of individual attention heads into capsules, which are then iteratively processed to produce a final aggregated representation, with the lower layers benefiting the most from this approach.	{"tags": ["architecture", "attention", "transformers", "deep-learning"], "doc_id": "aa1e0322-3d75-4010-8a56-af98c83245cf", "summary": "Some researchers argue that the standard summation method for aggregating outputs from multiple attention heads in multi-head attention may not fully utilize the mechanism's expressiveness.

multi-query attention, head size, attention mechanism, memory bandwidth\nKey Objects: attention heads, memory bandwidth, head size\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does multi-query attention improve decoding speed?\n- Why is it important to consider the size of attention keys?\n- What are the trade-offs when modifying the multi-head attention mechanism?\n---\nSummary:\nSeveral modifications to the multi-head mechanism have been proposed to improve attention, including multi-query attention which reduces memory bandwidth and disentangling head size from the number of heads to better represent distributions.\nOriginal Text:\n4.6.4 Other Modifications. Several other modifications to the multi-head mechanism have been proposed to improve multi-head attention.  \nShazeer [117] propose multi-query attention, where key-value pairs are shared among attention heads (i.e., to use only one key projection and one value projection for all attention heads). The advantage of this method is that it reduces the memory bandwidth requirements for decoding and results in a model that is faster to decode, while incurring only minor quality degradation from the baseline.  \nBhojanapalli et al. [11] establish that small attention key size can affect its ability to represent arbitrary distribution. They thus propose to disentangle head size from the number of heads h , as opposed to the common practice that sets the head size to be D$\\_{m}$/h . It is observed empirically that setting attention head size to be input sequence length is beneficial.\nContextualized Text:\nTo further enhance multi-head attention, several modifications have been introduced. For example, Shazeer proposed multi-query attention, which reduces memory bandwidth for decoding by sharing key-value pairs across attention heads. Additionally, Bhojanapalli et al. addressed the impact of small attention key sizes by proposing to disentangle head size from the number of heads, a departure from standard practices.	{"tags": ["NLP", "deep-learning", "attention", "transformers"], "doc_id": "00ddb65b-c179-4c65-9ce3-39684fa02a4f", "summary": "Several modifications to the multi-head mechanism have been proposed to improve attention, including multi-query attention which reduces memory bandwidth and disentangling head size from the number of heads to better represent distributions.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["BERT", "Shazeer", "Bhojanapalli"], "keywords": ["multi-query attention", "head size", "attention mechanism", "memory bandwidth"], "key_objects": ["attention heads", "memory bandwidth", "head size"], "contextual_text": "To further enhance multi-head attention, several modifications have been introduced.

permutation equivariant, convolution, recurrence networks, self-attention, positional information, transformer architecture\nKey Objects: permutation equivariant function, Convolution networks, Recurrence networks, self-attention modules, positional information\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What does it mean for a function to be 'permutation equivariant'?\n- Why is permutation equivariance a potential problem when modeling sequences of text?\n- What are some ways to inject positional information into Transformers to address this issue?\n---\nSummary:\nConvolution and Recurrence networks are not permutation equivariant, while self-attention modules and feed-forward layers in Transformers are. This can be problematic when modeling sequence data where order is important, necessitating the addition of positional information.\nOriginal Text:\n$$f ( \\pi x ) = \\pi f ( x ).$$  \nIt is easy to verify that Convolution and Recurrence networks are not permutation equivariant. However, both self-attention modules and position-wise feed-forward layers in Transformer are permutation equivariant, which could be a problem when it comes to modeling problems other than set-input problems where the structure of inputs is needed. For example, when modeling sequences of text, the ordering of words matters and it's thus crucial to properly encode the positions of words in Transformer architecture. Therefore, additional mechanisms are required to inject positional information into Transformers. A common design is to first represent positional information using vectors and then infuse the vectors to the model as an additional input.\nContextualized Text:\nIn Transformer architectures, while self-attention modules and feed-forward layers exhibit permutation equivariance, Convolution and Recurrence networks do not.  This presents a challenge when modeling sequential data where the order of elements is significant.  Therefore, mechanisms to encode positional information are required to inject positional information into Transformers.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "permutation"], "doc_id": "30477ff3-f931-44b2-9bad-d122624fa3ac", "summary": "Convolution and Recurrence networks are not permutation equivariant, while self-attention modules and feed-forward layers in Transformers are.

positional encodings, sinusoidal functions, absolute position representations, token embeddings, Transformer\nKey Objects: Positional Encodings, Token Embeddings, Frequency\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why were sinusoidal functions chosen for positional encoding?\n- What is the purpose of having different frequencies for different dimensions of the positional encoding?\n- How does adding positional encodings to token embeddings affect the model's understanding of sequence order?\n---\nSummary:\nIn the original Transformer model, absolute sinusoidal position encodings are used to represent positional information. These encodings are vectors where each element is a sinusoidal function of the position index, with frequencies defined for each dimension, and are added to token embeddings before being fed to the Transformer.\nOriginal Text:\n5.1.1 Absolute Position Representations. In vanilla Transformer [137], positional information is encoded as absolute sinusoidal position encodings. For each position index t , the encoding is a vector p$\\_{t}$ = PE ( t ) ∈ R $^{D$\\_{m}$}$, of which every element is a sinusoidal (sin/cos) function of the index with pre-defined frequency.  \n$$P E ( t ) _ { i } = \\begin{cases} \\sin ( \\omega _ { i } t ) & \\text {if i is even,} \\\\ \\cos ( \\omega _ { i } t ) & \\text {if i is odd,} \\end{cases}$$  \nwhere ω$\\_{i}$ is the hand-crafted frequency for each dimension. The position encoding of each position in the sequence is then added to the token embeddings and fed to Transformer.\nContextualized Text:\nThe original Transformer model encodes positional information using absolute sinusoidal position encodings.  For each position index, a vector encoding is generated using sinusoidal (sine/cosine) functions based on a pre-defined frequency. This vector, denoted as p₁, is then added to the token embeddings and fed to the Transformer.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "positional encoding"], "doc_id": "e776da59-728f-440c-b5f4-ee313733a9a9", "summary": "In the original Transformer model, absolute sinusoidal position encodings are used to represent positional information.

position encodings, sinusoidal functions, learned embeddings, sequence length, inductive\nKey Objects: position encodings, absolute position representations, token embeddings\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is the purpose of adding position encodings to token embeddings?\n- Why are learned positional embeddings limited in sequence length?\n- How do sinusoidal position encodings provide information about sequence order?\n---\nSummary:\nVanilla Transformers utilize absolute sinusoidal position encodings, which are vectors whose elements are sinusoidal functions of the position index. Alternatively, learned positional embeddings can be used, but these are limited by the maximum sequence length seen during training.\nOriginal Text:\nwhere ω$\\_{i}$ is the hand-crafted frequency for each dimension. The position encoding of each position in the sequence is then added to the token embeddings and fed to Transformer.  \nAnother way of representing absolute positions is to learn a set of positional embeddings for each position [28, 37]. Compared to hand-crafted position representation, learned embeddings are more flexible in that position representation can adapt to tasks through back-propagation. But the number of embeddings is limited up to a maximum sequence length determined before training, which makes this approach no longer inductive , i.e., not able to handle sequences longer than sequences seen in the training time [20, 85].\nContextualized Text:\nIn vanilla Transformers, absolute positional information is encoded. A common method is to use absolute sinusoidal position encodings, which are vectors constructed from sinusoidal (sin/cos) functions of the position index. These encodings are added to the token embeddings before being fed to the Transformer.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "positional encoding"], "doc_id": "6570a177-3b21-4481-90e4-ee048780dfa9", "summary": "Vanilla Transformers utilize absolute sinusoidal position encodings, which are vectors whose elements are sinusoidal functions of the position index.

adopted in various fields besides NLP, including CV and audio processing, due to its flexible architecture.  \n- (1) Natural Language Processing. Transformer and its variants have been extensively explored and applied in NLP tasks, e.g., machine translation [35, 91, 104, 123, 137], language modeling [24, 103, 111, 122] and named entity recognition [80, 154]. Massive effort has been dedicated to pre-training Transformer models on large-scale text corpora, which we believe is one of the major reasons of Transformer's wide application in NLP.\nContextualized Text:\nThe Transformer architecture, initially created for machine translation, has demonstrated remarkable adaptability, leading to its adoption in fields beyond natural language processing (NLP), such as computer vision (CV) and audio processing.

positional representations, sinusoidal encoding, Neural ODE, inductiveness, FLOATER\nKey Objects: positional representations, sinusoidal encoding, Neural ODE\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are the advantages of learning sinusoidal frequencies compared to using fixed frequencies?\n- How does Neural ODE contribute to the efficiency and flexibility of positional representations?\n- Why is inductiveness a desirable property in positional encoding approaches?\n---\nSummary:\nWang et al. introduced a method to learn sinusoidal positional frequencies from data, enhancing flexibility compared to hand-crafted approaches. FLOATER utilized a continuous dynamical system with Neural ODE for end-to-end training, offering a parameter-efficient and inductive approach.\nOriginal Text:\nWang et al. [139] propose to use sinusoidal position representation, but with each frequency ω$\\_{i}$ (in Eq. (28)) learned from data. This approach retains inductiveness but is more flexible than hand-crafted sinusoidal encoding. FLOATER [85] frames positional representation as a continuous dynamical system and adopts Neural ODE to enable end-to-end training with backpropagation.  \nThis method is inductive and flexible while being parameter efficient compared to a fully learnable approach.  \nThe Vanilla approach to incorporating absolute position representations is to add position encodings/embeddings to token embeddings. However, as the input signals propagate through the layers, the positional information might get lost in the upper layers. Later works find it beneficial to add position representations to inputs to each Transformer layer [2, 26, 45, 85].\nContextualized Text:\nTo improve upon hand-crafted methods for encoding positional information in Transformers, Wang et al. proposed learning the sinusoidal frequencies used in position encodings from data.  Additionally, FLOATER frames positional representation as a continuous dynamical system utilizing Neural ODE for efficient, end-to-end training. This method maintains the property of inductiveness while being more flexible than fully learnable approaches.	{"tags": ["NLP", "transformer", "architecture", "positional encoding"], "doc_id": "2cf160dd-50ea-4653-a229-a1ed1b928f83", "summary": "Wang et al. introduced a method to learn sinusoidal positional frequencies from data, enhancing flexibility compared to hand-crafted approaches.

relative position representations, self-attention, positional relationships\nKey Objects: relative position embeddings, attention mechanism, keys\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why would modeling relationships between tokens be more beneficial than modeling their absolute positions?\n- How does adding a learnable relative position embedding to the attention mechanism keys help the model?\n- What is the significance of clipping (max/min) relative position embeddings?\n---\nSummary:\nSome Transformer models utilize relative position representations, which focus on modeling relationships between tokens rather than their absolute positions, to improve performance.\nOriginal Text:\n5.1.2 Relative Position Representations. Another line of works focuses on representing positional relationships between tokens instead of positions of individual tokens. The intuition is that in self-attention, pairwise positional relationships between input elements (direction and distance) could be more beneficial than positions of elements. Methods following this principles are called relative positional representation. Shaw et al. [116] propose to add a learnable relative position embedding to keys of attention mechanism  \n$$k _ { j } ^ { \\prime } = k _ { j } + r _ { j }, \\, \\, f o r \\, \\, i = 1, \\cdots, n,$$  \n$$r _ { i j } = R _ { i j } ( i - j ),$$  \n$$c l i p ( x ) = \\max ( - K, \\min ( x, K ) ),$$\nContextualized Text:\nTo enhance the ability of Transformers to understand the structure of inputs, some research focuses on relative position representations.

relative position embeddings, attention mechanism, token relationships\nKey Objects: Relative Position Embeddings, Keys, Attention Mechanism\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why would representing relationships between tokens be more beneficial than representing individual token positions?\n- How does the parameter 'K' influence the effectiveness of relative position representations?\n- What are some advantages of using relative position representations over absolute position encodings?\n---\nSummary:\nRelative position representations introduce learnable embeddings to keys in the attention mechanism, calculated based on the difference between token positions, to capture relationships between tokens.\nOriginal Text:\n$$k _ { j } ^ { \\prime } = k _ { j } + r _ { j }, \\, \\, f o r \\, \\, i = 1, \\cdots, n,$$  \n$$r _ { i j } = R _ { i j } ( i - j ),$$  \n$$c l i p ( x ) = \\max ( - K, \\min ( x, K ) ),$$  \nwhere r$\\_{ij}$ ∈ R D k is the relative position embedding for relation between position i and j and K is the largest offset that determines the number of embeddingg. Typically K is set to a length that can accommodate most input sequences. As a special case, InDIGO [39] sets K to 3 for their specially designed framework for non-autoregressive generation. As an incremental effort, Music Transformer [56] further introduce a mechanism to reduce the intermediate memory requirements for this approach. Similar to this approach, T5 Raffel et al. [104] adopt a simplified form of relative position embeddings where each embedding is only a learnable scalar that is added to the corresponding score used for computing the attention weights.\nContextualized Text:\nTo represent positional relationships between tokens instead of individual token positions, relative position representations add learnable embeddings to the keys of the attention mechanism.  These embeddings, denoted as 'r_ij', are calculated based on the difference between the positions of tokens 'i' and 'j', and a parameter 'K' limits the maximum offset used for these embeddings. This approach is utilized in models like InDIGO, Music Transformer, and T5 to improve the model's understanding of token relationships.	{"tags": ["NLP", "transformers", "attention", "positional encoding"], "doc_id": "f2658249-5e01-4879-abde-2ce05b458f96", "summary": "Relative position representations introduce learnable embeddings to keys in the attention mechanism, calculated based on the difference between token positions, to capture relationships between tokens.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["InDIGO", "Music Transformer", "T5"], "keywords": ["relative position embeddings", "attention mechanism", "token relationships"], "key_objects": ["Relative Position Embeddings", "Keys", "Attention Mechanism"], "contextual_text": "To represent positional relationships between tokens instead of individual token positions, relative position representations add learnable embeddings to the keys of the attention mechanism.

attention scores, sinusoidal encoding, positional relationships, Transformer-XL, DeBERTa\nKey Objects: attention scores, sinusoidal encoding, positional relationships\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does fusing content and positional information benefit the Transformer model?\n- What is the significance of using a sinusoidal encoding matrix in this approach?\n- In what ways does DeBERTa build upon the techniques used in Transformer-XL?\n---\nSummary:\nTransformer-XL fuses content and positional information by redesigning the attention score computation using a sinusoidal encoding matrix (R) and learnable parameters, allowing for a more integrated representation of positional relationships.\nOriginal Text:\nTransformer-XL [24] use a sinusoidal encoding to represent positional relationships but fuses contents and position information by redesign the computation of attention scores 9  \n$$A _ { i j } = q _ { k } ^ { \\dagger } + q _ { i } ( R _ { i j } - W _ { i } R ^ { k } ) ^ { T } + u _ { i } ^ { 1 } + u _ { j } ^ { 2 } + u _ { k } ^ { 2 } ( R _ { i j } - W _ { i } K _ { r, R } ) ^ { T },$$  \nwhere W K R, R ∈ R D m × D$\\_{k}$, u 1 , u 2 ∈ R D$\\_{k}$ are learnable parameters and R is a sinusoidal encoding matrix similar to position encoding in vanilla Transformer. Then softmax function is applied to scores A to provide attention weights. Note that the learnable sinusoidal encoding[139] is also a drop-in replacement to hand-crafted R.  \nDeBERTa [50] utilizes position embeddings like Shaw et al. [116] and applies the embeddings to the model in a disentangled style similar to Transformer-XL [24]\nContextualized Text:\nTo represent positional relationships, Transformer-XL reworks the attention score computation. This involves using a sinusoidal encoding matrix (R) and learnable parameters (W, u) that combine content and position information.  The approach, which uses a sinusoidal encoding matrix (R) and learnable parameters, is also adopted by DeBERTa, which utilizes position embeddings in a style similar to Transformer-XL.	{"tags": ["architecture", "transformer", "positional encoding"], "doc_id": "4c3895cf-fe6e-4aa4-a270-c825c441b077", "summary": "Transformer-XL fuses content and positional information by redesigning the attention score computation using a sinusoidal encoding matrix (R) and learnable parameters, allowing for a more integrated representation of positional relationships.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer-XL", "DeBERTa"], "keywords": ["attention scores", "sinusoidal encoding", "positional relationships", "Transformer-XL", "DeBERTa"], "key_objects": ["attention scores", "sinusoidal encoding", "positional relationships"], "contextual_text": "To represent positional relationships, Transformer-XL reworks the attention score computation.

DeBERTa, position embeddings, relative position, disentangled style, Transformer-XL\nKey Objects: position embeddings, attention mechanism\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does DeBERTa’s disentangled style of applying position embeddings differ from previous methods?\n- What advantages does DeBERTa gain from incorporating the design principles of Transformer-XL?\n- What role do the learnable parameters Wₖᵊ and Wᵌ,ᵊ play in DeBERTa’s attention mechanism?\n---\nSummary:\nDeBERTa utilizes learned position embeddings, similar to Shaw et al., and applies them in a disentangled style, drawing parallels with Transformer-XL.\nOriginal Text:\nDeBERTa [50] utilizes position embeddings like Shaw et al. [116] and applies the embeddings to the model in a disentangled style similar to Transformer-XL [24]  \n$$A _ { i j } = q _ { k } ^ { \\dagger } J + q _ { i } ( r _ { i j } W _ { k, R } ^ { K } ) ^ { T } + k _ { j } ( r _ { i j } W _ { Q, R } ^ { Q } ) ^ { T },$$  \nwhere W K R, W Q, R ∈ R D m × D$\\_{k}$ are learnable parameters and r$\\_{ij}$ is the learnable relative positional embedding as in Eq. (30). The first term is interpreted as a content-to-content attention, and the latter two terms are interpreted as (relative) content-to-position and position-to-content attention, respectively.  \n5.1.3 Other Representations. Some research studies have explored using hybrid positional representations that contains both absolute and relative positional information. Transformer with Untied Position Encoding (TUPE) [63] re-designs the computation of attention scores as a combination  \n$^{9}$the scaling factor is omitted without loss of generality.\nContextualized Text:\nDeBERTa, building upon approaches like Shaw et al., incorporates learned position embeddings and applies them in a unique, disentangled style.

positional relationships, attention scores, position embeddings, relative position\nKey Objects: position embeddings, attention scores, relative position\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does combining these three terms - content-to-content, position-to-position, and relative position - provide a more comprehensive representation of positional information?\n- What are the advantages of using learnable parameters and position embeddings in this approach?\n- How does this hybrid positional representation compare to approaches that use only absolute or relative position encodings?\n---\nSummary:\nOne approach combines content-to-content, absolute position-to-position, and relative positional relationship terms in attention scores using learnable parameters and position embeddings, allowing for a unified representation of positional information.\nOriginal Text:\n$^{9}$the scaling factor is omitted without loss of generality.  \nof a content-to-content

Questions:\n- What does it mean for a representation to be 'translation invariant'?\n- How does the rotatory matrix encode positional information?\n- What are the advantages of using RoPE compared to

translation-invariant representation where attention scores depend on relative position offsets.\nOriginal Text:\n$$q _ { t } = x _ { 1 } W ^ { Q } R _ { e, t } \\ \\ k _ { t } = x _ { 1 } W ^ { K } R

Each M ( t, θ$\\_{j}$ ) is a 2-D clockwise rotatory matrix of angle t · θ$\\_{j}$  \n$$M ( t, \\theta _ { j } ) = \\left [ \\cos ( t \\cdot \\theta _ { j } ) \\ \\sin ( t \\cdot \\theta _ { j } ) \\right ] \\quad \\quad \\quad ( 3 7 )$$  \nThe key advantage of this formulation is that the induced representation is translation invariant, i.e., the attention score of ( q$\\_{k}$, j$\\_{k}$ ) is only related to their relative position offset  \n$$q _ { k, j } ^ { T } = \\left ( x _ { i } W ^ { Q } \\right ) R _ { e, j - i } ( x _ { j } W ^ { K } ) ^ { \\top } \\,.$$\nContextualized Text:\nReformer employs Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to encode token positions. This method multiplies token embeddings with rotatory matrices (Rₐ,ₜ), resulting in a representation that is translation invariant.  This means the attention score depends only on the relative position offset between tokens, not their absolute positions. This is achieved through the use of rotatory matrices and is a key component of the Reformer architecture.	{"tags": ["architecture", "transformer", "positional encoding", "representation"], "doc_id": "08e1c734-555f-4e8f-b403-62b54a2dd6d4", "summary": "Reformer utilizes Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to represent token positions by multiplying embeddings with rotatory matrices, resulting in a translation-invariant representation where attention scores depend on relative position offsets.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Reformer"], "keywords": ["Rotary Position Embedding", "RoPE", "translation invariance", "positional encoding"], "key_objects": ["Rotary Position Embedding", "Rotatory Matrix", "Attention Scores"], "contextual_text": "Reformer employs Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to encode token positions.

rotary position embedding, relative position, linearized attention, translation invariance\nKey Objects: Token Positions, Rotatory Matrix, Relative Positional Relations, Embedding Matrix Multiplication\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does RoPE’s translation invariance benefit transformer performance?\n- Why is it advantageous for RoPE to be compatible with linearized attention?\n- In what ways does RoPE's approach to positional encoding differ from traditional absolute positional encodings?\n---\nSummary:\nRotary Position Embedding (RoPE) utilizes a rotatory matrix to represent token positions, allowing for the capture of relative positional relations while being compatible with linearized attention and exhibiting translation invariance.\nOriginal Text:\n$$q _ { k, j } ^ { T } = \\left ( x _ { i } W ^ { Q } \\right ) R _ { e, j - i } ( x _ { j } W ^ { K } ) ^ { \\top } \\,.$$  \nIn practice, the embedding matrix multiplication can be implemented by two element-wise multiplication for lower memory footprint. The RoPE uses the form of absolute embedding but can capture relative positional relations. This approach is compatible with linearized attention in Sec. 4.2.  \n- 5.1.4 Position Representations without Explicit Encoding. Instead of explicitly introducing additional positional encodings, Wang et al. [140] propose to encode positional information in word embeddings, by generalizing embedding to continuous (complex-valued) functions over positions. R-Transformer [144] model locality of sequential data with a local RNN. Specifically, inputs to each block of R-Transformer are first fed to a local RNN and then to multi-Head self-attention module. The RNN structure introduces ordering information and captures local dependencies as a complement to self-attention.\nContextualized Text:\nRotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is a technique used in transformers. It uses a rotatory matrix to represent token positions, enabling the capture of relative positional relations. A key advantage is that it’s compatible with linearized attention and exhibits translation invariance, meaning attention scores are only related to the relative position offset between tokens. This allows the positional representation to function as an absolute embedding while still capturing relative information.	{"tags": ["NLP", "transformers", "positional encoding", "architecture"], "doc_id": "ff9f65af-e55f-46ce-9220-b3c023c37cab", "summary": "Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) utilizes a rotatory matrix to represent token positions, allowing for the capture of relative positional relations while being compatible with linearized attention and exhibiting translation invariance.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["RoPE", "R-Transformer", "RNN", "ViT"], "keywords": ["rotary position embedding", "relative position", "linearized attention", "translation invariance"], "key_objects": ["Token Positions", "Rotatory Matrix", "Relative Positional Relations", "Embedding Matrix Multiplication"], "contextual_text": "Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is a technique used in transformers.

conditional positional encoding, ViT, convolution, positional information, zero-padding\nKey Objects: positional information, convolutional networks, conditional position encodings\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does zero-padding in convolutional networks help encode positional information?\n- What is the benefit of using conditional positional encodings versus traditional positional encodings?\n- Why is positional encoding important for transformers and how does CPE address this need?\n---\nSummary:\nConditional positional encoding (CPE) for Vision Transformer (ViT) uses 2D convolutions with zero-padding to generate conditional position encodings at each layer, leveraging the ability of convolutional networks to implicitly encode positional information.\nOriginal Text:\nConditional positional encoding (CPE) [20] generate conditional position encodings at each layer for ViT with a 2-D convolution with zero-paddings. The intuition behind this approach is that convolution networks can implicitly encode absolute positional information with zeropaddings [60].  \n- 5.1.5 Position Representation on Transformer Decoders. It is worth noticing that masked selfattention is not permutation equivariant [133]. Thus a model that exploits only the decoder of Transformer has the potential of sensing positional information without incorporating explicit positional representation. This is confirmed by some empirical results on language modeling tasks [59, 113], where the authors find that removing position encodings even improves performance.\nContextualized Text:\nIn the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, a technique called conditional positional encoding (CPE) generates position encodings at each layer using 2D convolutions with zero-padding.

Layer Normalization, LN, residual connection, deep networks, training stabilization\nKey Objects: Layer Normalization, residual blocks\nRefers to Images: ./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_12.png\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is Layer Normalization used in conjunction with residual connections?\n- What specific training problems does Layer Normalization aim to solve?\n- How does Layer Normalization contribute to the overall stability of deep networks?\n---\nSummary:\nLayer Normalization (LN), often used with residual connections, is a mechanism to stabilize the training of deep networks by addressing issues like ill-posed gradients and model degeneration.\nOriginal Text:\n### 5.2 Layer Normalization  \nLayer Normalization (LN), along with residual connection, is considered as a mechanism to stabilizing training of deep networks (e.g., alleviating ill-posed gradients and model degeneration). There are some studies that are dedicated to analyzing and improving LN module.  \nFig. 11. Comparison of Transformer Encoder with pre-LN and post-LN.  \n  \n5.2.1 Placement of Layer Normalization. In vanilla Transformer, the LN layer lies between the residual blocks, called post-LN [141]. Later Transformer implementations [67, 136] place the LN layer inside the residual connection before the attention or FFN, with an additional LN after the final layer to control the magnitude of final outputs, which is referred to as pre-LN $^{10}$. The pre-LN has been adopted by numerous following research studies and implementations, e.g., [6, 17, 141]. The difference between pre-LN and post-LN is shown in Fig. 11.\nContextualized Text:\nWithin the Transformer architecture, Layer Normalization (LN) is frequently employed alongside residual connections to improve training stability by mitigating problems such as ill-posed gradients and model degeneration.

title: Comparison of LayerNorm Placement in Self-Attention\nTags: self-attention, layer-normalization, neural-network, architecture, comparison\nKey objects: Self-Attention, Feed-Forward Network, LayerNorm, Input, Output\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates two different architectures for incorporating Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) within a self-attention mechanism. Both diagrams show a self-attention block, but differ in the placement of the LayerNorm. (a) shows LayerNorm *after* the self-attention and feed-forward network, while (b) shows LayerNorm *before* both.\nFull description:\nThe diagrams compare two architectures for implementing self-attention. Both diagrams take an input and pass it through a self-attention mechanism.  In architecture (a), labeled 'post-LN', the output of the self-attention layer is then processed by a feed-forward network (FFN). Following the FFN, the result goes through a LayerNorm (LN) before being outputted. In architecture (b), labeled 'pre-LN', LayerNorm is applied *before* both the self-attention layer and the feed-forward network, then the result is outputted.\nText found in image:\n- (a) post-LN\n- (b) pre-LN	{"tags": ["self-attention", "layer-normalization", "neural-network", "architecture", "comparison"], "title": "Comparison of LayerNorm Placement in Self-Attention", "doc_id": "3e60e82d-bf7f-4118-92f6-a1b80d8e2777", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_12.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates two different architectures for incorporating Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) within a self-attention mechanism.

gradients, warm-up, post-LN, pre-LN, Transformer\nKey Objects: gradients, learning rate warm-up\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why are large gradients a problem during the initial stages of training?\n- What is a learning rate warm-up, and why is it needed for post-LN Transformers?\n- What is the fundamental difference in gradient behavior between pre-LN and post-LN Transformers?\n---\nSummary:\nXiong et al. investigated Transformer gradients and found large gradients near the output layer in post-LN Transformers, which can cause unstable training without a learning rate warm-up. This issue is not present in pre-LN Transformers, allowing for the safe removal of the warm-up stage.\nOriginal Text:\nXiong et al. [151] theoretically investigate the gradients of Transformers and find that the gradients near the output layer are large at initialization in post-LN Transformers, which could be the reason why post-LN Transformers without learning rate warm-up [137] 11 leads to unstable training, whereas pre-LN Transformers do not suffer from the same problem. They thus deduce and empirically verify that warm-up stage can be safely removed for pre-LN Transformers.\nContextualized Text:\nIn studying Transformer models, Xiong et al. found that post-LN Transformers, when not using a learning rate warm-up, experience unstable training due to large gradients near the output layer. This issue is not observed in pre-LN Transformers, allowing for the safe removal of the learning rate warm-up stage.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "training"], "doc_id": "3eed7a8f-ab2c-44f5-8397-20e7e4c05a69", "summary": "Xiong et al. investigated Transformer gradients and found large gradients near the output layer in post-LN Transformers, which can cause unstable training without a learning rate warm-up.

post-LN, pre-LN, gradient imbalance, residual branch, output shift\nKey Objects: post-LN Transformers, residual branch, output shift\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why do post-LN Transformers sometimes exhibit unstable training?\n- What is the 'amplification effect' mentioned in the text?\n- How do the introduced parameters help to control the output shift in post-LN Transformers?\n---\nSummary:\nDespite often leading to unstable training and divergence, post-Layer Normalization (post-LN) Transformers typically outperform pre-LN variants after achieving convergence.\nOriginal Text:\nAlthough Post-LN often results in unstable training and divergence, it usually outperforms preLN variants after convergence [83]. Similar to Xiong et al. [151], Liu et al. [83] conduct theoretical and empirical analysis and find that post-LN encoders do not suffer from gradient imbalance. They thus conjecture that the gradient issue is not the direct cause of unstable post-LN Transformer training and further identify the amplification effect in post-LN Transformers - at initialization, the heavier dependency on residual branch leads to a larger output shift in post-LN Transformers, thus resulting in unstable training. In light of this finding, they introduce additional parameters to post-LN Transformers to control residual dependencies of Post-LN. These parameters are initialized according to activation variations of sample data so that the output shift of post-LN Transformers is  \n$^{10}$To the best of our knowledge, this approach is adopted since v1.1.7 in the Tensor2Tensor implementation [136].\nContextualized Text:\nAlthough post-LN Transformers frequently exhibit unstable training and divergence, they generally achieve better performance than pre-LN variants once training converges.

post-LN, pre-LN, residual dependencies, convergence\nKey Objects: post-LN Transformers, pre-LN Transformers, residual dependencies\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why do post-LN Transformers sometimes lead to unstable training?\n- How do the introduced parameters help to control residual dependencies in post-LN Transformers?\n- What is the significance of using Tensor2Tensor in the implementation of this approach?\n---\nSummary:\nLiu et al. introduced parameters to control residual dependencies in post-LN Transformers to prevent output shift, ensuring convergence and achieving better performance than pre-LN Transformers.\nOriginal Text:\n$^{10}$To the best of our knowledge, this approach is adopted since v1.1.7 in the Tensor2Tensor implementation [136].  \n$^{11}$Learning rate warm-up refers to starting optimization with an extremely small learning rate and then gradually increasing it to a pre-defined maximum value in a certain number of iterations.  \nnot amplified. This approach ensures and boosts convergence of post-LN Transformers and reaches better performance than pre-LN Transformers.\nContextualized Text:\nTo address instability issues and improve convergence in post-LN Transformers, Liu et al. introduced additional parameters designed to control residual dependencies. This approach prevents the amplification of output shift, leading to a more stable training process and ultimately enabling the post-LN Transformers to achieve better performance than pre-LN variants. This technique was adopted since version 1.1.7 in the Tensor2Tensor implementation.	{"tags": ["normalization", "training", "optimization"], "doc_id": "29d9c611-e000-4654-8140-f4e1da93160b", "summary": "Liu et al. introduced parameters to control residual dependencies in post-LN Transformers to prevent output shift, ensuring convergence and achieving better performance than pre-LN Transformers.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Tensor2Tensor"], "keywords": ["post-LN", "pre-LN", "residual dependencies", "convergence"], "key_objects": ["post-LN Transformers", "pre-LN Transformers", "residual dependencies"], "contextual_text": "To address instability issues and improve convergence in post-LN Transformers, Liu et al. introduced additional parameters designed to control residual dependencies.

Questions:\n- Why do post-LN Transformers often require specialized parameters to control residual dependencies?\n- What is the underlying reason AdaNorm avoids learnable parameters?\n- How does the

researchers introduced parameters to control residual dependencies, resulting in faster convergence and better performance compared to pre-LN Transformers.

This approach ensures and boosts convergence of post-LN Transformers and reaches better performance than pre-LN Transformers.  \n5.2.2 Substitutes of Layer Normalization. Xu et al. [153] empirically observe that the learnable parameters in the LN module do not work in most experiments, and even increase the risk of overfitting. They further conclude from controlled experiments that the forward normalization is not the reason why LN works for Transformer. From analysis and experiments, it is concluded that the derivatives of the mean and variance re-center and re-scale the gradients and play a significant role in LN. They thus propose AdaNorm , a normalization technique without learnable parameters  \n$$z = C ( 1 - k y ) \\, \\sigma, \\\\ \\mathbf x = \\frac { \\mathbf x - \\mu } { \\sigma },$$  \nwhere C , k are hyperparameters and GLYPH denotes element-wise multiplication. GLYPH and GLYPH are the mean and standard deviation of input x , respectively.\nContextualized Text:\nTo address instabilities in post-LN Transformers, researchers introduced parameters to control residual dependencies.

Layer Normalization, AdaNorm, scaled t₂ normalization, normalization, machine translation, low-resource settings\nKey Objects: Layer Normalization, Input, Normalization Technique, Machine Translation Datasets\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does AdaNorm's design contribute to avoiding overfitting compared to traditional Layer Normalization?\n- Why is scaled t₂ normalization considered more parameter-efficient than standard Layer Normalization?\n- In what specific scenarios would scaled t₂ normalization be most advantageous over other normalization techniques?\n---\nSummary:\nAdaNorm replaces Layer Normalization with a normalization technique without learnable parameters, utilizing hyperparameters C and k along with element-wise multiplication (GLYPH) to adjust input x based on its mean and standard deviation. Nguyen and Salazar then propose using scaled t₂ normalization, projecting inputs onto a sphere with a learned radius 'g' for improved parameter efficiency.\nOriginal Text:\nwhere C , k are hyperparameters and GLYPH denotes element-wise multiplication. GLYPH and GLYPH are the mean and standard deviation of input x , respectively.  \nNguyen and Salazar [93] propose to replace the LN module with scaled t$\\_{2}$ normalization. Given any input x of d -dimension, their approach project it onto a d - 1-sphere of learned radius g  \n$$z = g \\frac { \\mathbf x } { \\| x \\| },$$  \nwhere g is a learnable scalar. It is more parameter efficient compared to normal LN and is shown to be effective in machine translation datasets, especially in low-resource settings.\nContextualized Text:\nTo explore alternatives to Layer Normalization, AdaNorm is introduced as a technique without learnable parameters, focusing on modifying input x based on its mean and standard deviation using hyperparameters C and k. Complementing this, Nguyen and Salazar propose scaled t₂ normalization, projecting inputs onto a sphere with a learned radius 'g' for improved efficiency, particularly in low-resource machine translation scenarios.	{"tags": ["normalization", "deep learning", "NLP", "machine translation"], "doc_id": "2d84208d-dcdf-4724-b652-ed43c013af59", "summary": "AdaNorm replaces Layer Normalization with a normalization technique without learnable parameters, utilizing hyperparameters C and k along with element-wise multiplication (GLYPH) to adjust input x based on its mean and standard deviation.

Layer Normalization, Batch Normalization, PowerNorm, scaled t₂ normalization, machine translation, low-resource settings\nKey Objects: Layer Normalization, scaled t₂ normalization, Batch Normalization, PowerNorm\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is scaled t₂ normalization considered more parameter efficient than standard Layer Normalization?\n- What are the primary reasons why Batch Normalization performs poorly in Transformers for text data?\n- How does PowerNorm attempt to overcome the instabilities associated with Batch Normalization in Transformer

It is more parameter efficient compared to normal LN and is shown to be effective in machine translation datasets, especially in low-resource settings.  \nSheh et al. [121] discuss why Batch Normalization (BN) [58] performs poorly in Transformer for text data and conclude that BN's significant performance degradation stems from the instabilities associated with its batch statistics. They thus propose PowerNorm (PN) that has three modifications over BN: (1) it relaxes the zero-mean normalization; (2) it uses the quadratic mean of the signal, instead of the variance; (3) it uses running statistics for the quadratic mean, instead of using per-batch statistics. Specifically, for the t -th iteration, the PN computes the outputs as  \n$$z ^ { ( t ) } = \\gamma \\circ y ^ { ( t ) } + \\beta, \\\\ y ^ { ( t ) } = \\frac { x ^ { ( t ) } } { \\psi ^ { ( t - 1 ) } },$$\nContextualized Text:\nAs alternatives to Layer Normalization, Nguyen and Salazar introduced scaled t₂ normalization, a more parameter-efficient method particularly useful for machine translation tasks in low-resource settings. Following this, Sheh et al. investigated why Batch Normalization struggles with Transformer architectures for text data and presented PowerNorm, a modified version designed to address instabilities related to batch statistics.	{"tags": ["normalization", "deep-learning", "NLP", "machine translation"], "doc_id": "565edfef-c341-4cdf-9d42-f50bf78706f9", "summary": "Nguyen and Salazar propose scaled t₂ normalization as a more parameter-efficient alternative to Layer Normalization, demonstrating its effectiveness in machine translation, particularly in low-resource scenarios.

PowerNorm, Batch Normalization, Transformer, normalization, BN\nKey Objects: normalization, quadratic mean\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why does standard Batch Normalization perform poorly in Transformers for text data?\n- What are the specific modifications made in PowerNorm compared to Batch Normalization?\n- How does PowerNorm's use of running statistics improve performance?\n---\nSummary:\nPowerNorm (PN) modifies Batch Normalization (BN) to improve Transformer performance with text data by relaxing zero-mean normalization, using the quadratic mean instead of variance, and utilizing running statistics for the quadratic mean.\nOriginal Text:\n$$z ^ { ( t ) } = \\gamma \\circ y ^ { ( t ) } + \\beta, \\\\ y ^ { ( t ) } = \\frac { x ^ { ( t ) } } { \\psi ^ { ( t - 1 ) } },$$  \n$$( \\psi ^ { ( t ) ) } ) ^ { 2 } = \\alpha ( \\psi ^ { ( t - 1 ) } ) ^ { 2 } + ( 1 - \\alpha ) \\left ( \\frac { 1 } { | B | } \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { | B | } x ^ { ( t ) } x ^ { ( t ) } ^ { 2 } \\right ),$$  \nwhere 0   , GLYPH are the learnable parameters as in BN formulation.  \n5.2.3 Normalization-free Transformer. Besides LN, there is another mechanism to construct deeper neural network. ReZero [5] replace LN module with a learnable residual connection. For each module F ( · ), ReZero re-scales F ( · ) in the residual formulation:  \n$$H ^ { \\prime } = H + \\alpha \\cdot F ( H ),$$  \nwhere GLYPH is a learnable parameter with zero-initialization.  \nReplacing LN in Transformer with ReZero mechanism is verified to induce better dynamic isometry for input signals and leads to faster convergence.\nContextualized Text:\nTo address performance degradation in Transformers due to instabilities associated with Batch Normalization (BN), Sheh et al. [121] proposed PowerNorm (PN). PN improves upon BN by relaxing the zero-mean normalization, utilizing the quadratic mean instead of the variance, and using running statistics for the quadratic mean to enhance Transformer performance with text data.	{"tags": ["normalization", "deep-learning", "transformer", "architecture"], "doc_id": "e2ee1938-d75c-4025-9ca0-99d44779b834", "summary": "PowerNorm (PN) modifies Batch Normalization (BN) to improve Transformer performance with text data by relaxing zero-mean normalization, using the quadratic mean instead of variance, and utilizing running statistics for the quadratic mean.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["PowerNorm", "Batch Normalization", "Transformer"], "keywords": ["PowerNorm", "Batch Normalization", "Transformer", "normalization", "BN"], "key_objects": ["normalization", "quadratic mean"], "contextual_text": "To address performance degradation in Transformers due to instabilities associated with Batch Normalization (BN), Sheh et al.

performance, mitigating rank collapse and token-uniformity biases. Researchers have explored various modifications to the FFN module, including alterations to the activation function.\nOriginal Text:\n### 5.3 Position-wise FFN  \nDespite its simplicity, the position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) layers are important for a Transformer to achieve good performance. Dong et al. [32] observe that simply stacking selfattention modules causes a rank collapse problem, leading to token-uniformity inductive bias, and that the feed-forward layer is one of the important building blocks that mitigate this issue. Various works have explored modifications on the FFN module.  \n5.3.1 Activation Function in FFN . The vanilla Transformer [137] adopts the Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) activation for non-linearity in between the two FFN layers. Over time, several studies have explored different activation other than ReLU.  \nRamachandran et al. [106] try to replace ReLU in Transformer with Swish function f ( x ) = xsigmoid ( b x ) and observe that it consistently improve performance on WMT 2014 English-German dataset.\nContextualized Text:\nWithin the Transformer architecture, position-wise feed-forward networks (FFNs) play a key role in achieving good performance. Dong et al. found that stacking self-attention modules alone can cause issues, and the FFN layers help to mitigate this problem by introducing diversity and preventing token-uniformity biases. As a result, numerous researchers have investigated modifications to the FFN module.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "optimization"], "doc_id": "1b4b8e7b-bef7-45b8-a021-d1116c6450dc", "summary": "Position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) layers are crucial for Transformer performance, mitigating rank collapse and token-uniformity biases.

ReLU, Swish, GELU, GLU, FFN, activation function, Transformer\nKey Objects: ReLU, Swish, GELU, GLU, FFN, activation function\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why would replacing ReLU with a different activation function like Swish or GELU improve performance?\n- What are the potential drawbacks of using GLU, given that it introduces extra parameters?\n- How does GELU contribute to the prevalence of pre-trained language models?\n---\nSummary:\nResearchers have explored various replacements for the ReLU activation function within the feed-forward network (FFN) layers of Transformers, including Swish, GELU, and Gated Linear Units (GLU), to improve performance and efficiency.\nOriginal Text:\nRamachandran et al. [106] try to replace ReLU in Transformer with Swish function f ( x ) = xsigmoid ( b x ) and observe that it consistently improve performance on WMT 2014 English-German dataset.  \nGPT [101] replace ReLU with Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) [52] on language pre-training. It becomes the default practice for many pre-trained language models [28, 50].  \nShazeer [118] explore using Gated Linear Units (GLU) [25] and its variants as a drop-in replacement for ReLU in FFN. Their pre-training experiments show that the GLU variants consistently improve vanilla Transformer with ReLU activation. Note that GLU introduces extra parameters and the experiments are conducted with the intermediate dimension of FFN reduced to match the parameter count with baseline.  \n5.3.2 Adapting FFN for Larger Capacity . Several works have focused on expanding FFNs in order for a larger model capacity. The basic idea is to replace FFNs with similar structures with much more parameters.\nContextualized Text:\nWithin Transformer models, the feed-forward network (FFN) layers often utilize ReLU activation functions. However, several studies have investigated alternatives like Swish, Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU), and Gated Linear Units (GLU) to enhance performance. For instance, Ramachandran et al. replaced ReLU with Swish and observed improvements on the WMT 2014 English-German dataset. GPT utilized GELU for language pre-training, which has become a standard practice in many pre-trained language models.	{"tags": ["architecture", "optimization", "FFN", "Transformer"], "doc_id": "7247201b-d7c9-44d8-84d3-518b21e77340", "summary": "Researchers have explored various replacements for the ReLU activation function within the feed-forward network (FFN) layers of Transformers, including Swish, GELU, and Gated Linear Units (GLU), to improve performance and efficiency.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer", "GPT", "GELU"], "keywords": ["ReLU", "Swish", "GELU", "GLU", "FFN", "activation function", "Transformer"], "key_objects": ["ReLU", "Swish", "GELU", "GLU", "FFN", "activation function"], "contextual_text": "Within Transformer models, the feed-forward network (FFN) layers often utilize ReLU activation functions.

product-key memory, FFN, key-value pairs, attention mechanism, large-scale language modeling\nKey Objects: FFN, Product-Key Memory, Query Network, Key Selection Module, Value Lookup Table\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How do product-key memory layers mimic the attention mechanism?\n- What is the purpose of the query network, key selection module, and value lookup table in product-key memory layers?\n- Why would replacing FFN layers with product-key memory layers improve performance in large-scale language modeling?\n---\nSummary:\nLample et al. [69] explored replacing some Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers with product-key memory layers to enhance model capacity. These memory layers utilize a query network, key selection module, and value lookup table, mimicking an attention mechanism and demonstrating performance improvements with minimal computational overhead in large-scale language modeling.\nOriginal Text:\nLample et al. [69] replace some of the FFNs with the product-key memory layers. A product-key memory is composed of three components: a query network, a key selection module containing two sets of sub-keys, and a value lookup table. The model first projects an input to a latent space using the query network, and then compares the generated query to keys that are Cartesian product of the two sets of sub-keys from key selection module to get k nearest neighbors, and finally finds the corresponding values in a value lookup table using the k nearest keys and aggregates them to produce the final output. This process resembles the attention mechanism, in that the generated query attends to a large number of global key-value pairs. They thus propose a multideck mechanism for the key-product memory to further enlarge the capacity of this module. The experiments on large-scale language modeling suggest that this mechanism significantly improves performance with negligible computational overhead.\nContextualized Text:\nTo increase model capacity, Lample et al. [69] investigated replacing some Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers with product-key memory layers. These layers, composed of a query network, key selection module, and value lookup table, function similarly to an attention mechanism, allowing the model to attend to a large number of global key-value pairs. Experiments showed this approach significantly improved performance in large-scale language modeling with only a negligible increase in computational cost.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "Transformer", "memory", "attention"], "doc_id": "df8e6b6d-65be-493e-8e9a-8093a12f3b18", "summary": "Lample et al.

Mixture-of-Experts, FFN, MoE, routing function, experts\nKey Objects: FFN, MoE Layers, Experts, Routing Function\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the routing function determine which experts are activated?\n- What is the purpose of the auxiliary loss function used in conjunction with MoE layers?\n- What are the advantages and disadvantages of using MoE layers

where multiple FFNs (experts) are used and a routing function determines which experts are activated for each token.\nOriginal Text:\nSeveral studies exploits the idea of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)[120] to increase the capacity of FFNs. Gshard[71] uses sparsely-gated MoE layers to replace FFNs in Transformer. Each MoE layer consists of several FFNs (each called an expert) that are the same structure as position-wise FFNs in vanilla Transformer. The output of the layer is a weighted sum of the outputs of the FFNs, using gate values computed by a routing function g ( · ) . They design a learnable routing function that assigns tokens to experts, with auxiliary loss to satisfy balanced loads between experts and efficiency at the scale of length such that the experts can be distributed across multiple devices. For each forward pass of the MoE layer, only the experts with top-k gate values are activated.\nContextualized Text:\nResearchers have explored using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers to increase the capacity of Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) within a Transformer. In this approach, an MoE layer replaces the standard FFN and consists of several FFNs, referred to as 'experts'. A routing function then assigns tokens to these experts, and for each forward pass, only the experts with the top-k gate values are activated, allowing for increased model capacity.	{"tags": ["MoE", "architecture", "transformer", "scaling"], "doc_id": "77840b45-4cf9-4c53-a1c7-c98ed8b00aba", "summary": "To increase the capacity of Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in Transformers, researchers have explored using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, where multiple FFNs (experts) are used and a routing function determines which experts are activated for each token.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Gshard", "Transformer"], "keywords": ["Mixture-of-Experts", "FFN", "MoE", "routing function", "experts"], "key_objects": ["FFN", "MoE Layers", "Experts", "Routing Function"], "contextual_text": "Researchers have explored using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers to increase the capacity of Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) within a Transformer.

Mixture-of-Experts, routing, expert prototyping, Switch Transformer, MoE\nKey Objects: experts, routing function, MoE layers\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does routing tokens to a single expert in Switch Transformer improve pre-training speed?\n- What is the purpose of the auxiliary loss function in Switch Transformer and Yang et al.'s expert prototyping strategy?\n- Why is it beneficial to divide experts into groups when applying routing?\n---\nSummary:\nSwitch Transformer optimizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers by routing tokens to a single expert with the highest gate value, which significantly speeds up pre-training while maintaining a similar computational cost. Subsequently, Yang et al. propose expert prototyping, splitting experts into groups and applying top-1 routing within each, improving model quality with consistent costs.\nOriginal Text:\nInstead of using k experts for each forward pass, Switch Transformer [36] proposes to route using only a single expert with the largest gate value, leading to a much smaller computational footprint. The authors also design an auxiliary loss to encourage load balance between experts. It is reported to speed up pre-training by a large margin compared to the non-MoE counterpart while having a similar number of FLOPS.  \nYang et al. [155] propose to replace top-k routing with expert prototyping strategy. Specifically, the proposed strategy splits experts into k different groups and applies top-1 routing within each group. The outputs of prototype groups are combined linearly to form the final output of the MoE layer. This strategy is proved to improve the model quality while maintaining constant computational costs.\nContextualized Text:\nTo increase the capacity of Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), several works explore Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers. Switch Transformer optimizes this approach by routing each token to the single expert with the largest gate value, which dramatically improves pre-training speed.  Yang et al. then introduce expert prototyping, dividing experts into groups and applying top-1 routing within each to enhance model quality while maintaining consistent computational costs.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "MoE"], "doc_id": "7fea08c4-5932-4a1b-bd5b-6710f1ea358e", "summary": "Switch Transformer optimizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers by routing tokens to a single expert with the highest gate value, which significantly speeds up pre-training while maintaining a similar computational cost.

hash layers, expert assignment, Mixture-of-Experts, routing function, Switch Transformer\nKey Objects: hash layers, routing function, experts\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are the advantages of using hash layers compared to learnable routing functions?\n- Why would a routing function require auxiliary loss functions?\n- How does the use of hash layers contribute to the overall efficiency of the Transformer architecture?\n---\nSummary:\nRoller et al. [110] proposed using hash layers as an alternative to learnable routing functions for assigning tokens to experts within a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which eliminates the need for routing parameters or auxiliary loss functions and demonstrates competitive performance compared to methods like Switch Transformer [36].\nOriginal Text:\nAs opposed to using a learnable routing function for expert assignment, Roller et al. [110] design hash layers where tokens are hashed into a fixed number of buckets, each bucket corresponding to an expert. This approach requires no routing parameters or any auxiliary loss function, while showing competitive results with existing methods such as Switch Transformer [36].  \n5.3.3 Dropping FFN Layers. Notably, one might argue that under some circumstances, FFN layers can be dropped completely, resulting in a simplified network.\nContextualized Text:\nTo avoid using learnable routing functions for expert assignment in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer, Roller et al. [110] designed hash layers. These hash layers assign tokens to experts based on fixed buckets, which simplifies the process by removing the need for routing parameters and auxiliary loss functions, and showing competitive results compared to methods like Switch Transformer [36].	{"tags": ["MoE", "architecture", "optimization", "Transformer"], "doc_id": "c8b5b551-5ad5-4ad4-8814-f5f44a412348", "summary": "Roller et al.

FFN, Feed-Forward Network, Transformer, Dropping layers, training speed, inference speed\nKey Objects: FFN layers, Transformer decoder\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why would someone consider dropping FFN layers in a Transformer model?\n- How does dropping an FFN layer effectively turn it into an attention module?\n- What are the potential benefits of removing FFNs in the decoder of a Transformer?\n---\nSummary:\nResearchers have explored dropping Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers in Transformers, demonstrating that under certain conditions, these layers can be removed without significant performance loss, and even improving training and inference speed.\nOriginal Text:\n5.3.3 Dropping FFN Layers. Notably, one might argue that under some circumstances, FFN layers can be dropped completely, resulting in a simplified network.  \nSukhbaatar et al. [127] demonstrate that replacing the ReLU activation with Softmax and dropping the bias term in FFN effectively turns FFN into an attention module where position-wise inputs attend to a global key-value memory of D$\\_{fin}$ slots. They thus propose to drop the FFN module and add to the attention module a set of global key-value pairs, which are learnable parameters concatenated with key and values generated by inputs. This approach simplifies the structure of the network with no loss of performance.  \nYang et al. [157] empirically show that FFNs in the decoder of Transformer, despite its large number of parameters, is not efficient and can be removed safely with only slight or no loss of performance. This approach significantly boosts the training and inference speed.\nContextualized Text:\nIn Transformer models, researchers have investigated the possibility of eliminating Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers. Sukhbaatar et al. [127] showed that by replacing the ReLU activation with Softmax and dropping the bias term, FFN effectively transforms into an attention module. Yang et al. [157] further confirmed that FFNs in the Transformer decoder, despite having many parameters, can be removed without significant performance loss and boosts training and inference speed.	{"tags": ["architecture", "optimization", "efficiency", "transformer"], "doc_id": "c81a9085-4fd4-41e6-9c4e-c90361888adf", "summary": "Researchers have explored dropping Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers in Transformers, demonstrating that under certain conditions, these layers can be removed without significant performance loss, and even improving training and inference speed.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer", "ReLU", "Softmax"], "keywords": ["FFN", "Feed-Forward Network", "Transformer", "Dropping layers", "training speed", "inference speed"], "key_objects": ["FFN layers", "Transformer decoder"], "contextual_text": "In Transformer models, researchers have investigated the possibility of eliminating Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers.

module level to alleviate computation overheads, there are several attempts to adapt Transformer to be lightweight by modifications at a higher level.  \nSimilar to low-rank self-attention [45] that decomposes attention into a locality-constrained attention and a low-rank global attention, Lite Transformer [148] proposes to replace each attention module in Transformer with a two-branch structure, where one branch uses attention to capture long-range contexts while the other branch uses depth-wise convolution and linear layers to capture local dependencies. The architecture is lightweight both in terms of model size and computation, and is thus more suitable for mobile devices.\nContextualized Text:\nTo alleviate computation overheads, several attempts have been made to adapt the Transformer architecture for lightweight designs.  One such approach, similar to low-rank self-attention, involves replacing each attention module in the Transformer with a two-branch structure. One branch uses attention to capture long-range contexts, while the other utilizes depth-wise convolution and linear layers to capture local dependencies, making the resulting architecture suitable for mobile devices.	{"tags": ["architecture", "optimization", "NLP", "transformer"], "doc_id": "7c8cb13d-c699-46b2-aba7-20f16e77bb50", "summary": "Researchers have explored adapting the Transformer architecture for lightweight designs by making modifications at a higher level, such as replacing attention modules with two-branch structures.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Lite Transformer"], "keywords": ["Transformer", "attention module", "low-rank self-attention", "depth-wise convolution", "mobile devices"], "key_objects": ["Transformer architecture", "attention modules", "two-branch structure"], "contextual_text": "To alleviate computation overheads, several attempts have been made to adapt the Transformer architecture for lightweight designs.

funnel-like encoder, pooling, up-sampling, FLOPs, memory\nKey Objects: encoder architecture, hidden sequence\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does pooling along the sequence dimension reduce computational complexity?\n- What is the benefit of reconstructing the hidden sequence after pooling?\n- In what scenarios would using a Funnel Transformer be advantageous over a vanilla Transformer?\n---\nSummary:\nFunnel Transformer reduces computational cost and memory usage by employing a funnel-like encoder architecture that progressively shortens the hidden sequence using pooling and then reconstructs it with up-sampling.\nOriginal Text:\nFunnel Transformer [23] utilizes a funnel-like encoder architecture where the length of the hidden sequence is gradually reduced using pooling along the sequence dimension, and then recovered using up-sampling. The architecture effectively reduces the FLOPs and memory compared to the vanilla Transformer encoder. Naturally, one can use this architecture to build a deeper or wider model using the same computation resources.\nContextualized Text:\nTo create lightweight Transformer models, Funnel Transformer [23] introduces a funnel-like encoder architecture. This design gradually reduces the length of the hidden sequence through pooling operations along the sequence dimension and then recovers the full sequence using up-sampling. This technique effectively reduces the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and memory requirements compared to a standard Transformer encoder, allowing for the creation of deeper or wider models without increasing computational resources.	{"tags": ["architecture", "optimization", "NLP", "transformer"], "doc_id": "dfdac0d1-68e9-4b51-bd9f-175a427c6634", "summary": "Funnel Transformer reduces computational cost and memory usage by employing a funnel-like encoder architecture that progressively shortens the hidden sequence using pooling and then reconstructs it with up-sampling.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Funnel Transformer"], "keywords": ["funnel-like encoder", "pooling", "up-sampling", "FLOPs", "memory"], "key_objects": ["encoder architecture", "hidden sequence"], "contextual_text": "To create lightweight Transformer models, Funnel Transformer [23] introduces a funnel-like encoder architecture.

DeLight, Transformer block, self-attention, FFN, block-wise scaling\nKey Objects: DeLight block, Transformer block, FFN\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the 'expand-and-reduce' DeLight transformation module contribute to learning wider representations?\n- What is the purpose of the block-wise scaling strategy in DeLight?\n- In what ways does the DeLight block differ from a standard Transformer block in terms of its structure and operation?\n---\nSummary:\nDeLight [91] introduces a modified Transformer block, the DeLight block, that utilizes three sub-modules and a block-wise scaling strategy to achieve a deeper network with fewer parameters and operations.\nOriginal Text:\nDeLight [91] replaces the standard Transformer block with DeLight block, which consists of three sub-modules: (1) a expand-and-reduce" DeLight transformation module to learn wider representations with low computation requirements; (2) a single-head self-attention to learn pairwise interaction; (3) a lightweight "reduce-and-expand" FFN (as opposed to vanilla Transformer that first expands the dimension of hidden representations and then reduces them back to D$\\_{m}$ ). They also propose a block-wise scaling strategy that allows for shallow and narrower blocks near the input and wider and deeper blocks near the output. The induced network is much deeper than the vanilla Transformer but with fewer parameters and operations.\nContextualized Text:\nTo reduce computational overhead in Transformer models, DeLight [91] replaces the standard Transformer block with a DeLight block. This block comprises three sub-modules: (1) an expand-and-reduce DeLight transformation module for learning wider representations; (2) a single-head self-attention mechanism to capture pairwise interactions; and (3) a lightweight reduce-and-expand Feed Forward Network (FFN), differing from the standard Transformer which expands and then reduces dimensions back to Dm. A block-wise scaling strategy is also implemented, allowing for shallow and narrow blocks near the input and wider, deeper blocks near the output, resulting in a deeper network with fewer parameters and operations.	{"tags": ["architecture", "optimization", "transformer"], "doc_id": "70d5b7e8-8d15-4120-a802-35c77c10b00b", "summary": "DeLight [91] introduces a modified Transformer block, the DeLight block, that utilizes three sub-modules and a block-wise scaling strategy to achieve a deeper network with fewer parameters and operations.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["DeLight"], "keywords": ["DeLight", "Transformer block", "self-attention", "FFN", "block-wise scaling"], "key_objects": ["DeLight block", "Transformer block", "FFN"], "contextual_text": "To reduce computational overhead in Transformer models, DeLight [91] replaces the standard Transformer block with a DeLight block.

cross-block connectivity, signal flow, Transformer blocks, attention distributions\nKey Objects: Transformer blocks, attention distributions, signal paths\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is creating more signal paths between Transformer blocks potentially beneficial?\n- How do Realformer and Predictive Attention Transformer achieve cross-block connectivity?\n- What kind of optimization issues might arise from the default architecture that these approaches aim to alleviate?\n---\nSummary:\nTo improve signal flow and potentially ease optimization in Transformer networks, some architectures explore creating additional pathways for information to traverse between blocks.\nOriginal Text:\n### 6.2 Strengthening Cross-Block Connectivity  \nIn vanilla Transformer, each block takes outputs from the previous block as inputs and outputs a sequence of hidden representations. One might be interested in creating more paths along which input signals can run through the networks. In Sec. 4.5.2, we introduced Realformer [51] and Predictive Attention Transformer [143] that reuses attention distributions from previous block to guide attention of current block. This can be seen as creating a forward path between adjacent Transformer blocks.\nContextualized Text:\nIn vanilla Transformer models, each block receives outputs from the preceding block and generates hidden representations.

cross-attention modules, encoder representations, optimization issues, vanishing gradients, Transparent Attention\nKey Objects: cross-attention modules, encoder representations, error signal\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is it problematic for cross-attention modules to only use the final encoder outputs?\n- How does Transparent Attention improve optimization in deep Transformer models?\n- What are trainable parameters involved in Transparent Attention?\n---\nSummary:\nIn deep Transformer encoder-decoder models, relying solely on the final encoder outputs in cross-attention modules can lead to optimization challenges like vanishing gradients. Transparent Attention addresses this by using a weighted sum of encoder representations across all layers.\nOriginal Text:\nIn a deep Transformer encoder-decoder model, the cross-attention modules in the decoder only utilize the final outputs of the encoder, therefore the error signal will have to traverse along the depth of the encoder. This makes Transformer more susceptible to optimization issues (e.g., vanishing gradients). Transparent Attention [8] uses a weighted sum of encoder representations at all encoder layers (including the embedding layer) in each cross-attention module. For the j -th decoder block, the cross-attention module is modified to attend to  \n$$\\tilde { H } ( j ) = \\sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { N } \\exp ( w _ { i j } ) \\frac { H ( i ) } { \\exp ( w _ { k j } ) },$$  \nwhere each w$\\_{ij}$ is a trainable parameter. This effectively shortens the path from each layer in the encoder to the error signal and thus eases the optimization of deeper Transformer models.\nContextualized Text:\nDeep Transformer encoder-decoder models often face optimization problems, such as vanishing gradients, because cross-attention modules typically only use the final outputs of the encoder. To mitigate this, Transparent Attention introduces a modification: it utilizes a weighted sum of encoder representations from all encoder layers within each cross-attention module. This approach effectively shortens the path for the error signal and improves optimization, especially in deeper Transformer models.	{"tags": ["architecture", "optimization", "NLP", "transformer"], "doc_id": "b48b308c-ee7a-4115-9d38-95a59e5a2ba9", "summary": "In deep Transformer encoder-decoder models, relying solely on the final encoder outputs in cross-attention modules can lead to optimization challenges like vanishing gradients.

Questions:\n- How does shortening the error signal path benefit the optimization of deep Transformer models?\n- What is the role of the trainable parameters (w_{ij}) in Transparent Attention?\n- Why is it problematic for error signals to have to traverse the entire depth of the encoder?\n---\nSummary:\nTransparent Attention utilizes trainable parameters (w_{ij}) to create a weighted sum of encoder representations at all layers, shortening the path for error signals and easing the optimization of deeper Transformer models.\nOriginal Text:\nwhere each w$\\_{ij}$ is a trainable parameter. This effectively shortens the path from each layer in the encoder to the error signal and thus eases the optimization of deeper Transformer models.  \nAnother issue associated with vanilla Transformer is that each position can only attend to history representations from lower layers. Feedback Transformer [34] proposes to add a feedback mechanism to Transformer decoder, where each position attends to a weighted sum of history representations from all layers  \n$$\\tilde { h } _ { i } = \\sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { N } \\frac { \\exp ( w _ { i j } ) } { \\sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { N } \\exp ( w _ { k } ) }.$$\nContextualized Text:\nTo address the issue of long error signal paths in deep Transformer models, Transparent Attention modifies the cross-attention module to attend to a weighted sum of encoder representations at all layers.

Questions:\n- How does ACT improve performance on challenging data?\n- What are the potential drawbacks of introducing adaptive computation time?\n- Could ACT be combined with other Transformer variants to further enhance performance?\n---\nSummary:\nAdaptive Computation Time (ACT) is a modification to Transformer models that conditions the computation time based on input data, potentially leading to better feature refinement for difficult examples and increased efficiency for simpler ones.\nOriginal Text:\n### 6.3 Adaptive Computation Time  \nVanilla Transformer, like most neural models, utilizes a fixed (learned) computation procedure to process each input. An intriguing and promising modification is to make computation time conditioned on the inputs, i.e., to introduce Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) [38] into Transformer models. Such modifications potentially give rise to the following advantages:  \n- · Feature refinement for hard examples. For data that are hard to process, a shallow representation might not be adequate to fulfill the task at hand. It would be more ideal to apply more computations to acquire a deeper and more refined representation.\n- · Efficiency for easy examples. When processing easy examples, a shallow representation might be enough for the task. In this case, it would be beneficial if the network can learn to extract features using reduced computation time.\nContextualized Text:\nUnlike standard Transformer models that use a fixed computation procedure, Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) adjusts the computation time based on the input.

adaptive computation time, universal transformer, dynamic halting, recurrent neural networks, transformers\nKey Objects: representations, symbols, halting probability, module\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the dynamic halting mechanism contribute to efficiency in UT?\n- What is the purpose of using a module that is shared over depth in UT?\n- How does the halting probability influence the overall computation process in UT?\n---\nSummary:\nUniversal Transformer (UT) refines representations iteratively using a shared module and a dynamic halting mechanism, which stops recurrence when a symbol's halting probability exceeds a threshold or a maximum step is reached.\nOriginal Text:\nUniversal Transformer (UT) [26] incorporates a recurrence-over-depth mechanism that iteratively refines representations for all symbols using a module that is shared over depth, as illustrated in Fig. 12(a). It also adds a per-position dynamic halting mechanism that calculates a halting probability for each symbol at every time step. If a symbol's halting probability is greater than a predefined threshold, then the symbol's representation will remain unchanged for subsequent timesteps. The recurrence is stopped when all symbols halt or when a predefined maximum step is reached.  \nConditional Computation Transformer (CCT) [7] adds a gating module at each self-attention and feed-forward layer to decide whether to skip the current layer, as illustrated in Fig. 12(b). The authors also introduce an auxiliary loss that encourages the model to adjust the gating modules to match the practical computation cost to the available computation budget.  \nFig. 12. Three typical ACT paradigms.\nContextualized Text:\nAs an Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) approach, Universal Transformer (UT) iteratively refines representations for all symbols using a shared module and a dynamic halting mechanism.

title: Three Control Flow Diagrams\nTags: control-flow, algorithm, program-structure, dynamic-halting, conditional-skip, early-exit\nKey objects: Decision, Process, Flow Lines, Dynamic Halting, Conditional Skip, Early Exit\n---\nSummary:\nThis image presents three distinct control flow diagrams illustrating different programming techniques: dynamic halting, conditional skip, and early exit. Each diagram uses basic control flow elements like decisions (diamonds) and processes (rectangles) to represent their respective workflows.\nFull description:\nThe first diagram (a) depicts 'dynamic halting'. It begins with a process and then transitions to a decision point labeled 'halt'. Depending on the outcome of this decision, the flow either terminates or loops back to the initial process. The second diagram (b) shows 'conditional skip'.  The flow starts with a process and then moves to a decision point labeled 'skip'. The decision determines whether the process continues or is bypassed. The third diagram (c) illustrates 'early exit'. The flow begins with a process and directly proceeds to a decision point labeled 'exit'.  Based on this decision, the flow either terminates the process or returns to a previous state, which is not depicted in the image.\nText found in image:\n- halt\n- skip\n- exit	{"tags": ["control-flow", "algorithm", "program-structure", "dynamic-halting", "conditional-skip", "early-exit"], "title": "Three Control Flow Diagrams", "doc_id": "7aff8ecf-de15-4753-868e-cd8ced0a3199", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_13.png", "summary": "This image presents three distinct control flow diagrams illustrating different programming techniques: dynamic halting, conditional skip, and early exit.

early exit, adaptive computation, speed-accuracy trade-off, internal classifier\nKey Objects: internal classifiers, early exit mechanisms, number of layers\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are the potential benefits of using early exit mechanisms in Transformer models?\n- How does the criteria used to determine when to exit a layer impact the overall performance of the model?\n- What are some challenges associated with training and implementing early exit mechanisms?\n---\nSummary:\nEarly exit mechanisms adapt the number of layers used for each input to balance speed and accuracy, often employing internal classifiers at each layer and using criteria to determine when to exit.\nOriginal Text:\nSimilar to the dynamic halting mechanism used in UT, there is a line of work dedicated to adapting the number of layers to each input in order to achieve a good speed-accuracy trade-off, which is called early exit mechanism, as illustrated in Fig. 12(c). A commonly used technique is to add an internal classifier at each layer and jointly train all classifiers. The core of these methods is the criteria used to decide whether to exit at each layer. DeeBERT [150] uses the entropy of the output probability distribution of the current layer to determine whether to exit. PABEE [171] counts the number of times that the predictions remain unchanged to decide whether to exit. Li et al. [79] design a window-based uncertainty criterion to achieve token-level partial exiting for sequence labeling tasks. Sun et al. [129] introduces a voting-based exiting strategy that considers at each layer predictions of all the past internal classifiers to infer the correct label and to decide whether to exit.\nContextualized Text:\nTo improve efficiency in Transformer models, researchers have explored early exit mechanisms. These mechanisms adapt the number of layers used for each input to achieve a good speed-accuracy trade-off. A common approach involves adding internal classifiers at each layer and training them jointly. The decision to exit a layer is based on specific criteria, such as DeeBERT's use of entropy or PABEE's tracking of prediction stability.	{"tags": ["architecture", "optimization", "efficiency", "transformers"], "doc_id": "7014b697-c5e1-4db9-a5a6-c95cfac9cf68", "summary": "Early exit mechanisms adapt the number of layers used for each input to balance speed and accuracy, often employing internal classifiers at each layer and using criteria to determine when to exit.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["DeeBERT", "PABEE", "Li et al.", "Sun et al."], "keywords": ["early exit", "adaptive computation", "speed-accuracy trade-off", "internal classifier"], "key_objects": ["internal classifiers", "early exit mechanisms", "number of layers"], "contextual_text": "To improve efficiency in Transformer models, researchers have explored early exit mechanisms.

the performance of some downstream tasks. For example, language modeling usually needs long-range context. Apart from the techniques introduced in Sec. 4, another effective way of dealing with long sequences is to use divide-and-conquer strategy, i.e., to decompose an input sequence into finer segments that can be efficiently processed by Transformer or Transformer modules. We identify two representative class of methods, recurrent and hierarchical Transformers, as illustrated in Fig. 13. These techniques can be understood as a wrapper for the Transformer model in which Transformer acts as an elementary component that is reused to process different input segments.  \nFig. 13. Illustrations of recurrent and hierarchical Transformers.  \n\nContextualized Text:\nDue to the quadratic complexity of self-attention with increasing sequence length, techniques like divide-and-conquer strategies are useful.

title: Recurrent and Hierarchical Transformer Architectures\nTags: transformer, architecture, recurrent, hierarchical, neural-network\nKey objects: Recurrent Transformer, Hierarchical Transformer, Transformer Block, Level 1, Level 1 Output, Level 1 to Level 2, Level 2, Level 2 Output\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates two transformer architectures: recurrent and hierarchical. The recurrent transformer (left) shows data flowing sequentially through multiple transformer blocks. The hierarchical transformer (right) depicts a hierarchical structure where transformer blocks are organized in multiple levels, creating a layered processing approach.\nFull description:\nThe diagram presents two different approaches to transformer architecture. The recurrent transformer (left) shows a sequential data flow. Data enters the system and passes through multiple 'Transformer' blocks in a chain. The hierarchical transformer (right) presents a more complex, multi-layered structure. Data first goes through a level of 'Transformer' blocks labeled 'Level 1'. The output from 'Level 1' is then fed into a second level of 'Transformer' blocks, labelled 'Level 2'. The output from 'Level 2' represents the final processed information.\nText found in image:\n- (a) Recurrent Transformer\n- (b) Hierarchical Transformer\n- Level 1\n- Level 1 Output\n- Level 1 to Level 2\n- Level 2\n- Level 2 Output	{"tags": ["transformer", "architecture", "recurrent", "hierarchical", "neural-network"], "title": "Recurrent and Hierarchical Transformer Architectures", "doc_id": "918f46ef-d2f8-45c5-b305-10a2d500a995", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_14.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates two transformer architectures: recurrent and hierarchical.

memory that incorporates historical information. This cache allows the network to read from and write to memory, extending the context window for processing text segments.\nOriginal Text:\nFig. 13. Illustrations of recurrent and hierarchical Transformers.  \n  \n6.4.1 Recurrent Transformers. In recurrent Transformers, a cache memory is maintained to incorporate the history information. While processing a segment of text, the network reads from the cache as an additional input. After the processing is done, the network writes to the memory by simply copying hidden states or using more complex mechanisms. The abstract process is illustrated in Fig. 13(a).  \nTransformer-XL [24] address the limitation of a fixed length context by caching representations from the previous segment and reuse it as an extended context when the model processes the current segment. For the l -th layer and the ( τ + 1)-th segment, the input representation H$\\_{(}$$\\_{l}$$\\_{-}$$\\_{1}$$\\_{)}$ is concatenated with the representation H ( l - 1 - 1 ) from previous segment to produce the keys and values\nContextualized Text:\nTo handle long sequences, recurrent Transformers employ a cache memory to incorporate historical information. While processing a segment of text, the network reads from this cache as an additional input, allowing it to maintain context across segments. The abstract process is illustrated in Fig. 13(a).	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformers", "recurrent"], "doc_id": "b5a36ce7-2c6c-4292-9eaf-134b8f3f10d8", "summary": "Recurrent Transformers address limitations in handling long sequences by maintaining a cache memory that incorporates historical information.

title: Recurrent vs. Hierarchical Transformer Architectures\nTags: transformer, neural-network, architecture, recurrent, hierarchical, sequence\nKey objects: Recurrent Transformer, Hierarchical Transformer, Input Sequence, Hidden State, Transformer Block, Lower-Level Transformer, Higher-Level Transformer\n---\nSummary:\nThis diagram illustrates two different approaches to transformer architectures: a recurrent transformer and a hierarchical transformer. The recurrent transformer processes a sequence iteratively, passing information between steps. The hierarchical transformer, on the other hand, processes the input sequence in a hierarchical manner, with lower-level transformers generating representations that are then fed into higher-level transformers.\nFull description:\nThe diagram presents two transformer architectures. (a) shows a recurrent transformer. An 'Input Sequence' is fed into the first 'Transformer Block'. The output of the first block then becomes the input to the next 'Transformer Block'. The previous output is also passed along to the next block which can be seen as a 'Hidden State'. (b) illustrates a hierarchical transformer. The input sequence is processed in a hierarchical manner.  'Lower-Level Transformers' process portions of the input, and their outputs are then passed to a 'Higher-Level Transformer'. This creates a hierarchy of representation, where the higher-level transformer operates on representations generated by the lower-level transformers.\nText found in image:\n- (a) Recurrent Transformer\n- (b) Hierarchical Transformer\n- Input Sequence\n- Hidden State\n- Transformer Block	{"tags": ["transformer", "neural-network", "architecture", "recurrent", "hierarchical", "sequence"], "title": "Recurrent vs. Hierarchical Transformer Architectures", "doc_id": "1ac84e0b-d5a7-4ed1-8019-368db32cdd4a", "source": "./images/a-survey-to-transformers/image_14.png", "summary": "This diagram illustrates two different approaches to transformer architectures: a recurrent transformer and a hierarchical transformer.

recurrence mechanism, history representations, context length, Transformer-XL, ERNIE-Doc\nKey Objects: history representations, context length\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the incorporation of history representations from the l-th layer impact the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies?\n- What is the difference between using representations from the (l-1)-th layer versus the l-th layer in the recurrence mechanism?\n- How does this approach address the limitations of a fixed-length context in traditional Transformers?\n---\nSummary:\nTransformer-XL and ERNIE-Doc enhance the recurrence mechanism by incorporating history representations from the l-th layer, resulting in a larger effective context length.\nOriginal Text:\n$$\\tilde { H } _ { ( l ) } ^ { + 1 } = [ S G H ^ { ( l - 1 ) } ] \\circ H ^ { ( l - 1 ) } _ { ( r - 1 ) },$$  \nERNIE-Doc [30] proposes an enhanced recurrence mechanism based on the recurrence mechanism used in Transformer-XL, by replacing the memory with the history representations from the l -th layer.  \n$$\\tilde { H } _ { r + 1 } ^ { ( l ) } = [ S G ( H _ { r } ^ { ( l ) } ) \\circ H _ { r + 1 } ^ { ( l - 1 ) } ],$$  \nas opposed to using representations from the ( l - 1)-th layer in Eq. (48). This modification essentially leads to a larger effective context length.\nContextualized Text:\nTo address limitations in context length, Transformer-XL and ERNIE-Doc enhance Transformer models using a recurrence mechanism.

recurrence mechanism, effective context length, Transformer-XL, ERNIE-Doc\nKey Objects: representations, context length\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does using representations from the l-th layer instead of (l-1)-th layer increase context length?\n- What is the purpose of using representations from a previous segment?\n- How does ERNIE-Doc differ from the original Transformer-XL architecture?\n---\nSummary:\nERNIE-Doc enhances Transformer-XL's recurrence mechanism by utilizing representations from the l-th layer instead of the (l-1)-th layer, which effectively increases the model's context length.\nOriginal Text:\nas opposed to using representations from the ( l - 1)-th layer in Eq. (48). This modification essentially leads to a larger effective context length.  \n6.4.2 Hierarchical Transformers. Hierarchical Transformer decomposes inputs hierarchically into elements of finer granularity. Low-level features are first fed to a Transformer encoder, producing output representations that are then aggregated (using pooling or other operations) to form a high-level feature, which is then processed by a high-level Transformer. This class of methods can be understood as a process of hierarchical abstraction. The overview of this approach is depicted in Fig. 13(b). The advantages of this approach are twofold: (1) Hierarchical modeling allows the model to handle long inputs with limited resources; (2) It has the potential to generate richer representations that are beneficial to tasks.\nContextualized Text:\nERNIE-Doc builds upon Transformer-XL's recurrence mechanism, which caches representations from previous segments.

For tasks with inherently long input length, one can use hierarchical Transformers for effective modeling of long-range dependencies. For documentlevel machine translation tasks, Miculich et al. [92] introduce dependencies on the previous sentences from both the source and target sides when translating a sentence. They use an attention mechanism as the aggregation operation to summarize low-level information. For document summarization, HIBERT [166] encodes a document of text by first learn sentence representations for all sentences and then use these sentence representations to encode document-level representations that are then used to generate the summary. The model uses the last hidden representation (corresponding to the EOS token) as the representation for each sentence. Liu and Lapata [86] propose a similar hierarchical Transformer for multi-document summarization where the extracted low-level representations are aggregated using an attention layer with a\nContextualized Text:\nTo effectively model long-range dependencies in tasks involving long input sequences, such as document-level machine translation and summarization, hierarchical Transformers are used.

hierarchical transformers, multi-document summarization, sentence transformer, document transformer, attention layer\nKey Objects: attention layer, sentence representations, document

using sentence and document Transformers in Hi-Transformer?\n- How does the global trainable query node in Liu and Lapata's model contribute to the summarization process?\n---\nSummary:\nLiu and Lapata [86] and Hi-Transformer [145] both utilize hierarchical Transformers to improve summarization, with Liu and Lapata using an attention layer and Hi-Transformer employing sentence and document Transformers to learn context-aware representations.\nOriginal Text:\nsentence. Liu and Lapata [86] propose a similar hierarchical Transformer for multi-document summarization where the extracted low-level representations are aggregated using an attention layer with a global trainable query node and low-level representations as the source of key-value pairs. Hi-Transformer [145] first utilizes a sentence Transformer and a document Transformer to hierarchically learn document context-aware sentence representations. The document context-aware sentence representations are then fed to another sentence Transformer to further improve the sentence context modeling.\nContextualized Text:\nFor multi-document summarization, Liu and Lapata [86] designed a hierarchical Transformer that aggregates extracted low-level representations using an attention layer with a global trainable query node.

hierarchical transformers, richer representations, character features, word embeddings, Vision Transformer, pixel representations\nKey Objects: character features, word embeddings, pixel representations, hierarchical models\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How do richer representations generated by hierarchical models lead to improved task performance?\n- What are the potential drawbacks of using hierarchical models for representation learning?\n- Can you describe a specific scenario where incorporating character features would be particularly beneficial?\n---\nSummary:\nHierarchical Transformers can also be utilized to create richer representations for improved task performance, such as incorporating character features alongside word embeddings using models like TENER or addressing pixel-level information loss in Vision Transformers using Transformer in Transformer (TNT).\nOriginal Text:\n6.5.2.2 Hierarchical for richer representations. One might also be interested in using hierarchical models to acquire richer representations that are beneficial to the tasks at hand. For example, TENER [154] uses a low-level Transformer encoder to encode character features, which is then concatenated with word embeddings as the inputs to the high-level Transformer encoder. This incorporates more features and alleviates the problems of data sparsity and out-of-vocabulary (OV). Recently emerging Vision Transformer [33] divides an input image into several patches that serve as the basic input elements of Transformer, which potentially loses intrinsic pixellevel information within patches. To address this issue, Transformer in Transformer (TNT) [48] uses at each layer an inner Transformer block that transforms pixel representations and an outer Transformer block that takes fused vectors of patch representations and pixel representations as input.\nContextualized Text:\nTo enhance task performance, hierarchical Transformers can be employed to acquire richer representations. For example, TENER [154] uses a low-level Transformer encoder to encode character features, which are then concatenated with word embeddings to feed into a high-level Transformer encoder. This approach incorporates more data and helps solve issues like data sparsity and out-of-vocabulary words, a common challenge in many NLP tasks.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "vision", "representation learning"], "doc_id": "140648cd-2507-4b00-9b29-ab5c691b6ec7", "summary": "Hierarchical Transformers can also be utilized to create richer representations for improved task performance, such as incorporating character features alongside word embeddings using models like TENER or addressing pixel-level information loss in Vision Transformers using Transformer in Transformer (TNT).", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["TENER", "Vision Transformer", "TNT"], "keywords": ["hierarchical transformers", "richer representations", "character features", "word embeddings", "Vision Transformer", "pixel representations"], "key_objects": ["character features", "word embeddings", "pixel representations", "hierarchical models"], "contextual_text": "To enhance task performance, hierarchical Transformers can be employed to acquire richer representations.

Text:\n### 6.5 Exploring Alternative Architecture  \nDespite the success of Transformer architecture, one might question whether the current Transformer architecture is optimal. Interestingly, several studies have explored alternative architectures for Transformer.  \nLu et al. [89] interpret Transformer as a numerical Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver for a convection-diffusion equation in a multi-particle dynamic system and design Macaron Transformer, which replaces each Transformer block with a FFN-attention-FFN variant.  \nSandwich Transformer [99] explores reorganizing attention modules and FFN modules such that attention modules are mainly located in lower layers and FFN modules in upper layers. The induced model improves perplexity on multiple language modeling benchmarks, without increasing parameters, memory or training time.\nContextualized Text:\nGiven the success of the Transformer architecture, researchers have questioned whether it is the most efficient design.

dynamic mask attention, self-attention, machine translation, abstractive summarization, text data\nKey Objects: Dynamic Mask Attention Module, Self-attention Module, Token Representations\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does the dynamic mask attention module in MAN contribute to modeling locality in text data?\n- What are the conditions that influence the dynamic mask in MAN?\n- What are the benefits of using a dynamic mask versus a static mask in the attention mechanism?\n---\nSummary:\nMask Attention Network (MAN) enhances Transformer blocks by adding a dynamic mask attention module, which improves performance in machine translation and abstractive summarization.\nOriginal Text:\nMask Attention Network (MAN) [35] prepends a dynamic mask attention module to the selfattention module in each Transformer block. The mask is conditioned on token representations, the relative distance between tokens and head indices. The proposed dynamic mask attention is shown to effectively model locality in text data and the induced model consistently outperforms the baseline model in machine translation and abstractive summarization.\nContextualized Text:\nTo explore alternatives to the standard Transformer architecture, researchers have proposed modifications like the Mask Attention Network (MAN). MAN prepends a dynamic mask attention module to the self-attention module within each Transformer block. This module's mask is conditioned on token representations, the distance between tokens, and head indices. The resulting architecture demonstrates effective modeling of locality in text data and consistently outperforms baseline Transformer models in machine translation and abstractive summarization.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "transformer", "attention"], "doc_id": "12238e00-172a-41c6-b99d-41412e8cfc23", "summary": "Mask Attention Network (MAN) enhances Transformer blocks by adding a dynamic mask attention module, which improves performance in machine translation and abstractive summarization.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer", "MAN"], "keywords": ["dynamic mask attention", "self-attention", "machine translation", "abstractive summarization", "text data"], "key_objects": ["Dynamic Mask Attention Module", "Self-attention Module", "Token Representations"], "contextual_text": "To explore alternatives to the standard Transformer architecture, researchers have proposed modifications like the Mask Attention Network (MAN).

Neural Architecture Search, Transformer architecture, Evolved Transformer, DARTsformer, architecture search\nKey Objects: Transformer architectures, Neural Architecture Search\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- How does Neural Architecture Search (NAS) differ from manually designing Transformer architectures?\n- What are the advantages of using evolution-based search (as in ET) versus differentiable search (as in DARTsformer)?\n- Why is reducing the search cost important when exploring alternative Transformer architectures?\n---\nSummary:\nResearchers are exploring Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques to discover and develop alternative Transformer architectures that improve performance and efficiency.\nOriginal Text:\nNotably, there's a line of work that uses Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to search for alternative Transformer architectures. The Evolved Transformer (ET) [123] employs evolution-based architecture search with the standard Transformer architecture seeding the initial population. The searched model demonstrates consistent improvement over Transformer on several language tasks. As another representative work, DARTsformer [167] applies differentiable architecture search (DARTS) [82], combined with a multi-split reversible network and a backpropagation-withreconstruction algorithm for memory efficiency. The resulting model consistently outperforms standard Transformer and compares favorably to larger ET models, with a significantly reduced search cost.\nContextualized Text:\nSeveral studies are investigating methods to automatically search for improved Transformer architectures.  Specifically, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques are being used to find alternatives. The Evolved Transformer (ET) utilizes evolution-based search, while DARTsformer employs differentiable architecture search (DARTS) to create models that consistently outperform standard Transformers with reduced search costs.	{"tags": ["NAS", "architecture", "optimization", "deep-learning"], "doc_id": "1ba04fea-dd9a-4968-a900-b423aea7514d", "summary": "Researchers are exploring Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques to discover and develop alternative Transformer architectures that improve performance and efficiency.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Evolved Transformer", "DARTsformer"], "keywords": ["Neural Architecture Search", "Transformer architecture", "Evolved Transformer", "DARTsformer", "architecture search"], "key_objects": ["Transformer architectures", "Neural Architecture Search"], "contextual_text": "Several studies are investigating methods to automatically search for improved Transformer architectures.

inductive bias, overfitting, Transformer architecture, data structure\nKey Objects: Transformer architecture, data structure, inductive bias\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What is meant by 'inductive bias of locality'?\n- How does the lack of inductive bias in Transformers affect their ability to generalize?\n- What are some potential methods for introducing inductive bias into Transformer models?\n---\nSummary:\nUnlike convolutional and recurrent networks, Transformers do not assume any structure in the data, making them highly versatile but also prone to overfitting when data is limited.\nOriginal Text:\n## 7 PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMERS  \nAs a key difference from convolutional networks and recurrent networks that inherently incorporates the inductive bias of locality, Transformer does not make any assumption about how the data is structured. On the one hand, this effectively makes Transformer a very universal architecture that has the potential of capturing dependencies of different ranges. On the other hand, this makes Transformer prone to overfitting when the data is limited. One way to alleviate this issue is to introduce inductive bias into the model.\nContextualized Text:\nA key difference between Transformers and convolutional or recurrent networks is that Transformers do not incorporate an inherent inductive bias of locality and make no assumptions about how the data is structured.

can learn general language representations that improve performance on specific downstream tasks, allowing for fine-tuning instead of training from scratch.\nOriginal Text:\nRecent studies suggest that Transformer models that are pre-trained on large corpora can learn universal language representations that are beneficial for downstream tasks [100]. The models are pre-trained using various self-supervised objectives, e.g., predicting a masked word given its context. After pre-training a model, one can simply fine-tune it on downstream datasets, instead of training a model from scratch. To illustrate typical ways of using Transformers in pre-training, we identify some of the pre-trained Transformers and categorize them as follows.  \n- · Encoder only. A line of work uses the Transformer encoder as its backbone architecture. BERT [28] is a representative PTM that is typically used for natural language understanding tasks. It utilizes Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) as the self-supervised training objective. RoBERTa [87] further adapts the training of BERT and removes the NSP objective as it is found to hurt performance on downstream tasks.\nContextualized Text:\nTransformer models, known for their flexibility, can be pre-trained on large datasets. These models learn general language representations that are beneficial for downstream tasks, allowing for fine-tuning instead of training a model from scratch. For instance, BERT and RoBERTa exemplify this approach, utilizing techniques like Masked Language Modeling and Next Sentence Prediction.	{"tags": ["NLP", "pre-training", "transformers", "deep-learning"], "doc_id": "b43a15bb-ab1a-4770-8b7d-74b0af4316b5", "summary": "Transformer models pre-trained on large datasets can learn general language representations that improve performance on specific downstream tasks, allowing for fine-tuning instead of training from scratch.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["BERT", "RoBERTa"], "keywords": ["pre-trained models", "language representations", "downstream tasks", "fine-tuning"], "key_objects": ["Transformer Models", "Language Representations", "Self-supervised objectives"], "contextual_text": "Transformer models, known for their flexibility, can be pre-trained on large datasets.

Transformer decoders, language modeling, GPT series, few-shot learning, prompts\nKey Objects: Transformer decoders, language modeling\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What advantages does pre-training Transformer decoders on language modeling offer?\n- How do prompts enable few-shot performance in models like GPT-3?\n- Why is scaling pre-trained Transformer decoders a

series, including GPT, GPT-2, and GPT-3, demonstrating impressive few-shot performance through scaling pre-trained decoders and using prompts.\nOriginal Text:\n- · Decoder only. Several studies focus on pre-training Transformer decoders on language modeling. For example, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series (i.e., GPT [101], GPT-2 [102], and GPT-3 [12]) is dedicated to scaling pre-trained Transformer decoders and has recently illustrated that a large-scale PTM can achieve impressive few-shot performance with the task and examples fed to the model as constructed prompts [12].  \n- · Encoder-Decoder. There are also PTMs that adopt Transformer encoder-decoder as the overall architecture. BART [72] extends the denoising objective of BERT to encoder-decoder architecture. The benefit of using an encoder-decoder architecture is that the inducing model is equipped with the ability to perform both natural language understanding and generation. T5 [104] adopts similar architecture and was one of the earliest studies that use task-specific text prefix in downstream tasks.\nContextualized Text:\nResearchers have explored pre-training Transformer decoders using language modeling techniques.

sparse attention, mixture-of-experts, BigBird, GPT-3, SwitchTransformer\nKey Objects: Sparse Attention, Mixture-of-Experts, FFN Layers\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- What are the advantages of using sparse attention mechanisms in Transformer models?\n- How does SwitchTransformer maintain efficiency while increasing the number of parameters?\n- In what ways do these architecture variants contribute to the overall capabilities of PTMs?\n---\nSummary:\nSeveral Transformer architecture variants, such as BigBird, GPT-3, and SwitchTransformer, have been adapted for use in pre-trained Transformer models (PTMs) to enhance their capabilities.\nOriginal Text:\nSome of the Transformer architecture variants can also be applied to Transformer-based PTMs. For instance, BigBird [163] introduced in Sec. 4.1 is a encoder-based PTM that uses compound position-based sparse attention to enable long sequence inputs. GPT-3 [12] uses alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention (which was also introduced in Sec. 4.1) in self-attention modules. SwitchTransformer [36] is an encoder-based PTM that replaces FFN layers with mixture-of-experts layers and can increase parameter count while keeping the FLOPs per example constant.\nContextualized Text:\nTo improve performance, several Transformer architecture variants are being incorporated into pre-trained Transformer models (PTMs).

computer vision, image classification, object detection, video processing\nKey Objects: Vision Tasks, Computer Vision\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is the flexible architecture of the Transformer so suitable for applications beyond NLP?\n- What are some of the specific challenges of adapting Transformers for computer vision tasks?\n- How do the techniques used in visual Transformers differ from those used in NLP Transformers?\n---\nSummary:\nTransformer models have been adapted for various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, image generation, and video processing.\nOriginal Text:\n- (2) Computer Vision. Transformer have also been adapted for various vision tasks, e.g., image classification [14, 33, 88], object detection [13, 88, 168, 172], image generation [61, 94] and video processing [3, 115]. Han et al. [47] and Khan et al. [64] provide reviews on existing work of visual Transformers. We encourage readers to refer to these surveys for further understand the current research progress on Transformers in CV.\n- (3) Audio Applications. Transformer can also be extended for audio-related applications, e.g., speech recognition [15, 31, 41, 97], speech synthesis [57, 76, 169], speech enhancement [65, 162] and music generation [56].\n- (4) Multimodal Applications. Owing to its flexible architecture, Transformer has also been applied in various multimodal scenarios, e.g., visual question answering [55, 75, 77, 125], visual commonsense reasoning [75, 125], caption generation [22, 81, 128], speech-to-text translation [46] and text-to-image generation [29, 81, 107].\nContextualized Text:\nOriginally designed for machine translation, the Transformer architecture's flexibility has enabled its adoption across diverse fields. In computer vision, Transformers are being used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, image generation, and video processing. Researchers interested in the current progress of visual Transformers are encouraged to consult the reviews by Han et al. and Khan et al.	{"tags": ["CV", "deep-learning", "architecture", "applications"], "doc_id": "4e6cdc5a-5214-4356-9e2c-d2f6c55e4e77", "summary": "Transformer models have been adapted for various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, image generation, and video processing.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["Transformer"], "keywords": ["computer vision", "image classification", "object detection", "video processing"], "key_objects": ["Vision Tasks", "Computer Vision"], "contextual_text": "Originally designed for machine translation, the Transformer architecture's flexibility has enabled its adoption across diverse fields.

comprehensive overview of X-formers and propose a new taxonomy. Most of the existing works improve Transformer from different perspectives, such as efficiency, generalization, and applications. The improvements include incorporating structural prior, designing lightweight architecture, pre-training, and so on.  \nAlthough X-formers have proven their power for various tasks, challenges still exist. Besides the current concerns (e.g. efficiency and generalization), the further improvements of Transformer may lie in the following directions:\nContextualized Text:\nThis survey offers a detailed examination of X-formers and presents a new way to categorize them.

Transformer, CNN, RNN, theoretical analysis, data structure\nKey Objects: Transformer architecture, training datasets, data structure assumptions\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why does the Transformer's flexibility, due to fewer assumptions, lead to better performance with large datasets?\n- What kind of theoretical analysis is needed to better understand the capabilities of Transformers?\n- How do the data structure assumptions of CNNs and RNNs limit their performance compared to Transformers?\n---\nSummary:\nTransformer architectures are capable of handling large datasets and often outperform CNNs and RNNs due to their flexibility and lack of strict data structure assumptions, but the theoretical basis for this capability remains unclear.\nOriginal Text:\n- (1) Theoretical Analysis. The architecture of Transformer has been demonstrated to be capable of supporting large-scale training datasets with enough parameters. Many works show that Transformer has a larger capacity than CNNs and RNNs and hence has the ability to handle a huge amount of training data. When Transformer is trained on sufficient data, it usually has better performances than CNNs or RNNs. An intuitive explanation is that Transformer has few prior  \nassumptions on the data structure and therefore is more flexible than CNNs and RNNs. However, the theoretical reason is unclear and we need some theoretical analysis of Transformer ability.\nContextualized Text:\nTransformer architectures have proven capable of supporting large-scale training datasets and often achieve better performance than CNNs and RNNs. This is partially because Transformers have fewer assumptions about the structure of the data, making them more flexible. However, the precise theoretical explanation for this capability remains unclear and warrants further investigation.	{"tags": ["deep-learning", "architecture", "theory", "NLP"], "doc_id": "0b188913-c172-45ad-a545-b3a52972e39c", "summary": "Transformer architectures are capable of handling large datasets and often outperform CNNs and RNNs due to their flexibility and lack of strict data structure assumptions, but the theoretical basis for this capability remains unclear.", "doc_type": "text", "entities": ["CNN", "RNN", "Transformer"], "keywords": ["Transformer", "CNN", "RNN", "theoretical analysis", "data structure"], "key_objects": ["Transformer architecture", "training datasets", "data structure assumptions"], "contextual_text": "Transformer architectures have proven capable of supporting large-scale training datasets and often achieve better performance than CNNs and RNNs.

mechanism for global interaction, while advantageous, is not always efficient, as full attention is often unnecessary. Future improvements should focus on developing more efficient global interaction modeling techniques.\nOriginal Text:\n- (2) Better Global Interaction Mechanism beyond Attention . A main advantage of Transformer is the use of the attention mechanism to model the global dependencies among nodes within input data. However, many studies have shown that full attention is unnecessary for most nodes. It is, to some degree, inefficient to indistinguishably calculate attention for all nodes. Therefore, there is still plenty of room for improvements in efficiently modeling global interactions. On the one hand, the self-attention module can be regarded as a fully-connected neural network with dynamical connection weights, which aggregates non-local information with dynamic routing. Therefore, other dynamic routing mechanisms are alternative approaches worth exploring. On the other hand, the global interaction can also be modeled by other types of neural networks, such as memory-enhanced models.\nContextualized Text:\nA core strength of the Transformer architecture is its use of the attention mechanism to model global dependencies within input data. However, research suggests that applying full attention to every node is often inefficient.  Therefore, there's significant potential to improve the efficiency of global interaction modeling through alternative approaches like dynamic routing mechanisms or memory-enhanced models.	{"tags": ["architecture", "NLP", "efficiency"], "doc_id": "ace31b21-23f5-4939-a895-1b3180f9143a", "summary": "The Transformer's reliance on the attention mechanism for global interaction, while advantageous, is not always efficient, as full attention is often unnecessary.

multimodal data, unified framework, semantic relations, cross-modal attention, intra-modal attention\nKey Objects: multimodal data, unified framework, attention\nRefers to Images: None\nHypothetical Questions:\n- Why is it beneficial to use multimodal data in AI applications?\n- What are some of the challenges in designing a unified framework for multimodal Transformers?\n- How could improved

for future Transformer research to create a unified framework capable of capturing semantic relationships across different data types.\nOriginal Text:\n- (3) Unified Framework for Multimodal Data . In many application scenarios, integrating multimodal data is useful and necessary to boost the task performance. Moreover, the general AI also needs the ability to capture the semantic relations across different modalities. Since Transformer achieves great success on text, image, video, and audio, we have a chance to build a unified framework and better capture the inherent connections among multimodal data. However, the design of the intra-modal and cross-modal attention still remains to be improved.  \nFinally, we wish this survey to be a hands-on reference for better understanding the current research progress on Transformers and help readers to further improve Transformers for various applications.\nContextualized Text:\nTo further improve Transformer models, researchers are exploring the development of a unified framework for integrating multimodal data like text, image, video, and audio.
